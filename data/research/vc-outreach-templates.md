## TEMPLATE 1: CONGRUENT VENTURES (Best Stage Fit)

**To**: Kevin Kopczynski or Abe Yokell
**Email**: investors@congruentvc.com
**Subject**: Doing more with less in solar soft costs

---

Hi [Kevin/Abe],

Solar soft costs now exceed 60% of residential system price. The 2026 ITC expiration, massive panel tariffs, and 20,000+ unique jurisdictional requirements have made compliance the biggest drag on the energy transition.

I run Pure Energy, a $100M/yr Texas solar company, and I built SolarOS to solve this. It is a national permit and compliance platform with a live API -- 106 jurisdictions, 50 states, equipment compliance tracking, and automated document generation. Not theory -- built from thousands of real installations.

I noticed Congruent led GridStrong's seed for utility-scale compliance. SolarOS is the residential/commercial complement -- same compliance pain, different customer. Together they would cover the full market.

The platform is deployed and functional at https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app with Stripe billing, Mercury ACH invoicing, and 6 API endpoints live.

Would 15 minutes work to discuss?

**Why Congruent**: They led seed rounds for GridStrong (grid compliance, $500K-$3M range) and Omnidian (residential solar assets). They explicitly invest at formation/seed stage. SolarOS fills the gap between their utility-scale compliance (GridStrong) and residential solar asset management (Omnidian) portfolio companies.

**Follow-up strategy**: If no response in 7 days, send one follow-up. If still no response, try LinkedIn DM to Kevin Kopczynski (oversees GridStrong) or Abe Yokell (Managing Partner).

## TEMPLATE 2: BLUE BEAR CAPITAL (Easiest Submission)

**Submit at**: https://bluebearcap.com/submit-a-deal/
**Target**: Ernst Sack (solar project finance background)

**Company Name**: SolarOS (Agentic Labs LLC)
**Website**: https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app
**Stage**: Pre-seed
**Sector**: Energy Software / Solar Compliance Automation
**Ask**: Seed investment

**One-Line Description**:
AI-powered national permit and compliance platform for solar installers, built by the CEO of a $100M Texas solar company.

**Longer Description** (for form):

The 2026 solar market reset (ITC expiration, 3,400% panel tariffs, net billing transition) created a compliance nightmare across 20,000+ jurisdictions. No unified data layer exists for installers navigating this.

SolarOS is an AI-powered compliance and permitting platform with:
- National permit database: 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states
- AI compliance engine: Domestic content, FEOC, tariff verification for 72+ equipment products
- Self-learning AI task engine: AI handles tasks, escalates to humans when uncertain, learns from every interaction
- Live API: 6 RESTful endpoints with Stripe subscription billing ($79-$299/mo)
- Full-stack platform deployed at https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app

I am the CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies ($100M peak revenue, thousands of installations). I built SolarOS because I was tired of watching my teams spend more time on paperwork than putting panels on roofs.

Given Blue Bear's investments in Raptor Maps (solar asset intelligence) and Transect (environmental permitting), SolarOS fits the thesis of machine intelligence applied to fragmented, paper-driven energy industries.

---

**Why Blue Bear**: They have a public deal submission form (lowest friction). Ernst Sack has deep solar project finance background. Their portfolio (Raptor Maps, Transect, Omnidian) proves the thesis for AI in solar/permitting. $5M initial checks are in range for a strong seed round.

---

## TEMPLATE 3: ENERGIZE CAPITAL (Deepest Solar Portfolio)

**To**: Juan Muldoon or Tyler Lancaster (Co-Heads, Ventures)
**Method**: LinkedIn message + follow-up email
**Email format**: lastname.firstinitial@energizecap.com (e.g., muldoon.j@energizecap.com)
**Subject**: Solar soft costs are 64% of system price -- we are fixing that

---

### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 char limit)

Hi [Juan/Tyler], I'm the CEO of a $100M/yr Texas solar company and built SolarOS -- AI-powered permit and compliance platform covering 106 jurisdictions. Given Energize's investments in Aurora Solar and GreenLite, I think there's a compelling thesis here. Would love 15 min to discuss.

---

### Follow-Up Email (after connection accepted)

Hi [Juan/Tyler],

The 2026 solar reset killed the residential ITC, shifted the market to TPO, and hit panels with up to 3,400% tariffs. Installers are drowning in compliance complexity across 20,000+ jurisdictions with no unified system.

I'm the CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies ($100M peak revenue, statewide coverage). After years of watching my teams spend more time on permitting paperwork than installations, I built SolarOS -- a national permit and compliance platform with a live API covering 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states.

I noticed Energize backed Aurora Solar for design and GreenLite for municipal permitting -- SolarOS is the missing installer-side layer: compliance engine, permit automation, and equipment verification that connects design to installation.

Key thesis for Energize: you have already invested in the permitting bottleneck thesis. Your "Why We Invested" post on GreenLite notes that municipalities drain developers of ~$50B annually in delays. SolarOS solves the other side of that equation -- what the installer needs to navigate those municipalities.

Platform is live: https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app

Would you have 15 minutes this month to discuss?

**Why Energize**: Deepest solar portfolio of any VC (Aurora Solar unicorn, GreenLite permitting, GridStrong compliance, PVcase design). They explicitly published thesis statements about permitting being a $50B bottleneck. Their check sizes ($5-20M) suggest Series A, but they have done earlier deals. Strong signal value even if they pass at this stage.

**Warm intro strategy**: Look for mutual connections to Aurora Solar, GreenLite, or GridStrong founders on LinkedIn. A warm intro through a portfolio company founder would be strongest.

## TEMPLATE 4: NATIONAL GRID PARTNERS (Utility Strategic VC)

**To**: Pradeep Tagare (VP, Head of Investments) or Kristian Bodek (Director, Investments)
**Method**: LinkedIn message
**Website contact**: https://www.ngpartners.com/ (contact form)

---

### LinkedIn Connection Request (300 char limit)

Hi [Pradeep/Kristian], I'm CEO of a $100M Texas solar company and built SolarOS -- AI compliance platform for solar installers (106 jurisdictions, 50 states). For National Grid, this means better visibility into the residential solar pipeline. Would love to discuss strategic fit.

---

### Follow-Up Message (after connection)

Hi [Pradeep/Kristian],

The 2026 solar reset (ITC expiration, tariff chaos, net billing transition) is reshaping the residential solar market. Installers face 20,000+ jurisdictions with no standardized compliance data, creating bottlenecks that slow interconnection queues and DER deployment.

I am the CEO of Pure Energy ($100M/yr, statewide Texas solar) and built SolarOS -- a national permit and compliance platform with a live API. 106 jurisdictions, 50 states, equipment compliance, automated workflows. The structured data layer for solar installations across every jurisdiction.

For National Grid, the strategic value is threefold:
1. **DER visibility**: Structured data on every residential solar installation flowing through the platform -- permits filed, equipment selected, interconnection status
2. **Interconnection queue acceleration**: Installers who submit compliant, complete applications process faster through utility queues
3. **Grid planning intelligence**: Aggregated permit data by jurisdiction enables better forecasting of DER growth

Similar to how AutoGrid (in your portfolio) gave you the VPP management layer, SolarOS provides the upstream installer intelligence layer.

$100M AI-for-energy commitment makes the timing right.

Platform is live: https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app

15 minutes to discuss the strategic fit?

**Why NGP**: Corporate VC with strategic mandate. If they invest, you get distribution through National Grid's utility operations. But requires a clear utility-value narrative. Their $100M AI commitment (announced 2025) creates a timely window.

**Risk**: NGP invests at Series A/B ($12-64M rounds). May be too early for pre-seed SolarOS. Frame as strategic relationship building -- even if investment is premature, a strategic partnership or pilot with National Grid would be transformative.

## TEMPLATE 5: GENERAL COLD EMAIL FOR CLIMATE TECH VCs

**For**: Clean Energy Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Fellows, Amazon Climate Pledge, Earthshot Ventures, or any climate tech VC
**Subject**: $100M solar company CEO builds AI permitting platform

---

Hi [Name],

I run Pure Energy, one of the largest residential solar companies in Texas ($100M peak revenue), and I have a problem: my teams spend more time on paperwork than putting panels on roofs.

So I built SolarOS -- an AI-powered platform that automates solar permitting and compliance across all 50 states. 106 jurisdictions in our permit database, real-time compliance verification for domestic content and FEOC requirements, and a self-learning AI that gets smarter with every project.

The 2026 ITC expiration forced every residential deal into TPO structures requiring commercial-grade compliance. Tariffs up to 3,400% on SE Asian panels created an equipment verification nightmare. SolarOS turns this complexity into a software opportunity.

Quick stats:
- 106 jurisdictions, 50 states
- 190+ incentive programs tracked
- 72+ equipment products with compliance scoring
- Live API with Stripe billing ($79-$299/mo)
- Platform deployed: https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app
- TAM: $4.2B in solar soft costs

This is not a pitch deck company -- it is a working platform built by someone who has done thousands of solar installations. I am raising a seed round and looking for investors who understand the solar compliance opportunity created by the 2026 market reset.

Would you have 15 minutes to discuss?

## TEMPLATE 6: WARM INTRO REQUEST

**For**: Asking a mutual connection to introduce you to a target VC partner. Send to the mutual connection.
**Subject**: Quick intro request -- [VC Partner Name] at [Firm]

---

Hi [Mutual Connection],

I noticed you are connected with [VC Partner Name] at [VC Firm]. I would appreciate an introduction if you are comfortable with it.

Quick context: I am the CEO of Pure Energy, one of the largest residential solar companies in Texas ($100M peak revenue). I built SolarOS, an AI-powered permitting and compliance platform for the solar industry. The platform is live and covers 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states.

[VC Firm] has invested in [relevant portfolio company], which makes me think there is a thesis fit for SolarOS -- we solve the installer-side permitting and compliance problem that their portfolio addresses from [the other angle].

I am raising a seed round and would love to get 15 minutes with [VC Partner]. No pressure at all if this does not feel right -- I appreciate you either way.

Thanks,
Justin

## INVESTOR MEETING PREPARATION

### If You Get a Meeting (15-30 min)

**Agenda**:
1. (2 min) Your background -- Pure Energy, $100M, thousands of installations
2. (3 min) The problem -- soft costs, 30K jurisdictions, 2026 reset
3. (5 min) Live demo -- show the platform working (permit lookup, compliance check)
4. (3 min) Market + business model -- TAM/SAM/SOM, pricing, unit economics
5. (2 min) Ask -- what you are raising, what you will do with it

**Prepare**:
- [ ] Live demo script (permit lookup for a specific jurisdiction, compliance check on a specific panel)
- [ ] 3 slides: Problem, Solution, Market (as backup if they want a deck)
- [ ] Financial model: Year 1-3 revenue projections
- [ ] Answer to: "Why hasn't someone built this already?" (Answer: Because you need to have DONE thousands of installations to understand what data matters. This is operator-built, not outsider-designed.)
- [ ] Answer to: "What about SolarAPP+?" (Answer: SolarAPP+ requires jurisdiction adoption and only covers standard residential. We work from the installer side and cover every jurisdiction whether they have SolarAPP+ or not. We are complementary, not competitive.)
- [ ] Answer to: "Solo founder risk?" (Answer: Pure Energy is my built-in team. 10+ years of solar operations. Hiring plan funded by this raise.)
