## 1. Energize Capital

**Website:** https://www.energizecap.com/
**HQ:** 1 South Wacker Drive, Suite 2350, Chicago, IL 60606
**Founded:** 2016
**AUM:** $700M+ across three funds (Fund III closed at $430M in 2025)

### Investment Thesis & Focus
Energize invests in "software and services that enable the transition to a digitized and decarbonized economy." They are explicitly an energy software investor -- asset-light, digitally-enabled solutions across energy, climate, and industrial sectors. Two strategies: Ventures (early-stage) and Endurance (PE/growth buyout).

Their thesis on permitting is notable: they believe "if you're bullish on climate, you're bullish on construction" and view permitting as a critical bottleneck draining developers of approximately $50B annually in municipal delays.

### Stage & Check Size
- **Stage:** Series A through Series C (Ventures); growth/buyout (Endurance)
- **Typical Check:** $15M-$20M (Fund III), but earlier deals in $5M-$10M range
- **Seed investments:** Occasional, average round size $10M

### Portfolio Companies (Solar/Permitting/Compliance Relevant)
| Company | Relevance | Since |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Aurora Solar** | Cloud-based solar design, sales, and delivery (UNICORN, $4B round) | 2019 |
| **GreenLite** | AI-enabled permitting and plan review platform | 2025 |
| **GridStrong** | Unified platform automating electric grid compliance and operations | 2025 |
| **PVcase** | Utility-scale solar design, estimation, optimization | 2023 |

| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **John Tough** | Co-Founder & Managing Partner | Investment Committee, leads firm |
| **Katie McClain** | Partner & COO | Investment Committee |
| **Juan Muldoon** | Co-Head, Ventures | Leads early-stage deals |
| **Tyler Lancaster** | Co-Head, Ventures | Leads early-stage deals |
| **Mark Tomasovic** | Principal | |
| **Eileen Waris** | Principal | |
| **Lauren Densham** | Partner, Head of Portfolio Services | Post-investment support |

### How to Apply
- **No public pitch form or email.** LinkedIn outreach or warm intro preferred.
- Email format: lastname.firstinitial@energizecap.com (e.g., tough.j@energizecap.com)
- They publish detailed "Why We Invested" blog posts -- reference these in outreach.
- Warm intros through their portfolio companies (Aurora Solar, GreenLite) would be strongest.

### Positioning Advice
- **STRONG FIT.** They already invested in Aurora Solar (design), GreenLite (permitting), and GridStrong (compliance). SolarOS fills the gap between these: the operational layer connecting design-to-permit-to-compliance for the installer/developer.
- Lead with the soft cost crisis and 2026 market reset. Their GreenLite thesis proves they understand the $50B permitting bottleneck.
- Differentiate from Aurora (design-only) and GreenLite (municipal-side permitting). SolarOS is installer-side: national database + compliance engine + API.
- **Target:** Juan Muldoon or Tyler Lancaster (Ventures co-heads).

## Cold Outreach Email Templates

### Template 1: Energize Capital

**To:** Juan Muldoon or Tyler Lancaster
**Subject:** Solar soft costs are 64% of system price -- we're fixing that

Hi [Name],

The 2026 solar reset killed the residential ITC, shifted the market to TPO, and hit panels with up to 3,400% tariffs. Installers are drowning in compliance complexity across 20,000+ jurisdictions with no unified system.

I'm the CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies ($100M peak revenue, statewide coverage). After years of watching my teams spend more time on permitting paperwork than installations, I built SolarOS -- a national permit and compliance platform with a live API covering 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states.

I noticed Energize backed Aurora Solar for design and GreenLite for municipal permitting -- SolarOS is the missing installer-side layer: compliance engine, permit automation, and equipment verification that connects design to installation.

Would you have 15 minutes this month to discuss?

CEO, Pure Energy & Founder, SolarOS

### Template 2: Blue Bear Capital

**To:** Ernst Sack
**Subject:** AI-powered compliance for the 2026 solar market

Hi Ernst,

The 2026 solar market reset (ITC expiration, 3,400% panel tariffs, net billing transition) created a compliance nightmare across 20,000+ jurisdictions. No unified data layer exists for installers navigating this.

I'm the CEO of Pure Energy ($100M peak revenue, statewide Texas solar), and I built SolarOS to solve the compliance nightmare I live every day. It's an AI-powered national permit and compliance platform -- live API, equipment compliance engine (domestic content, FEOC, tariff tracking), 106 jurisdictions across 50 states.

Given your solar project finance background and Blue Bear's investments in Raptor Maps and Transect, I think SolarOS fits your thesis of machine intelligence for energy verticals. Same pattern -- AI applied to a fragmented, paper-driven industry.

15 minutes to walk through the platform?

### Template 3: Congruent Ventures

**To:** Kevin Kopczynski or Abe Yokell
**Subject:** Doing more with less in solar soft costs

Hi [Name],

Solar soft costs now exceed 60% of residential system price. The 2026 ITC expiration, massive panel tariffs, and 20,000+ unique jurisdictional requirements have made compliance the biggest drag on the energy transition.

I run Pure Energy, a $100M/yr Texas solar company, and I built SolarOS to solve this. National permit and compliance database with a live API -- 106 jurisdictions, 50 states, equipment compliance tracking, and automated document generation. Not theory -- built from thousands of real installations.

I see Congruent led GridStrong's seed for utility-scale compliance. SolarOS is the residential/commercial complement -- same compliance pain, different customer. Together they'd cover the full market.

Would 15 minutes work to discuss?

### Template 4: National Grid Partners

**To:** Pradeep Tagare or Kristian Bodek
**Subject:** Solar compliance data layer for the 2026 grid

Hi [Name],

The 2026 solar reset (ITC expiration, tariff chaos, net billing transition) is reshaping the residential solar market. Installers face 20,000+ jurisdictions with no standardized compliance data, creating bottlenecks that slow interconnection queues and DER deployment.

I'm the CEO of Pure Energy ($100M/yr, statewide Texas solar) and built SolarOS -- a national permit and compliance platform with a live API. 106 jurisdictions, 50 states, equipment compliance, automated workflows. The structured data layer for solar installations across every jurisdiction.

For National Grid, this means better visibility into the residential solar pipeline and faster DER integration. Similar to how AutoGrid gave you the VPP layer, SolarOS provides the installer data layer.

15 minutes to discuss the strategic fit?
