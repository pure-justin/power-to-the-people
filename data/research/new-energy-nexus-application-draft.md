| **The Clean Fight (New York)** | MODERATE | International Landing Pad open | Deployment support | Built environment focus; software less aligned |
| **NEX Ventures** | LOW | Southeast Asia only | Fund investment | Geography mismatch — focuses on Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines |

### Climate Fintech Taxonomy (from NEX's Foundational Report)

New Energy Nexus defines climate fintech across eight verticals. SolarOS maps to multiple:

| NEX Vertical | SolarOS Feature | Strength |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Regtech** | Tax credit compliance engine (ITC, FEOC, domestic content, energy community bonuses) | PRIMARY FIT |
| **Lending** | TPO facilitation, solar financing workflow, bankability package automation | PRIMARY FIT |
| **Risk Analysis** | Equipment compliance scoring, tax credit risk assessment, audit trail generation | STRONG FIT |
| **Trading** | Tax credit marketplace (IRA Section 6418 transferability) | STRONG FIT |
| **Insurtech** | Tax credit insurance/guarantee platform | FUTURE FIT |
| **Investing** | Tax equity verification for institutional investors | FUTURE FIT |
| **Banking** | Mercury ACH invoicing, escrow for credit transactions | MODERATE FIT |
| **Payments** | Stripe billing, API marketplace monetization | MODERATE FIT |

### Past Climate Fintech Accelerator Cohorts

**2023 Cohort** (inaugural): 14 startups, 51 entrepreneurs, 8-month program. Focus: Web3 in Sustainability + Carbon Accounts.

**2024 Cohort**: Focus shifted to Web3 in Sustainability + Cross-Border Carbon Management. Companies included:
- Arkreen (blockchain renewable energy data)
- CarbonEase (manufacturing carbon management SaaS)
- CarbonPass (digital compliance for international brands)
- Cero Global (personal carbon wallet + cross-border payments)
- DIGICARBON (carbon pricing/finance APIs)
- SusallWave (green finance assessment platform)
- Skyco2 (carbon measurement systems)
- WeavAir (ESG analytics + satellite data)

**Key observation**: No company in their portfolio addresses solar tax equity compliance, TPO facilitation, or US domestic energy financing. SolarOS would be the first US-focused solar fintech in their accelerator. This is a gap we fill.

### NEX Climate Fintech Report Key Insight

From their foundational report (100+ interviews, 250+ companies mapped):

> "Soft costs like accounting and compliance make up roughly one-third of the total price tag for solar projects, creating bottlenecks and friction that inhibit some investors from wanting to invest in the energy transition at all."

This is exactly what SolarOS solves. Our compliance automation directly addresses the friction NEX identified as blocking climate finance deployment.

## PROGRAM-BY-PROGRAM ANALYSIS

### Program 1: Climate Fintech Accelerator (PRIMARY TARGET)

**Why this is the best fit:**
- Rolling applications — no hard deadline pressure
- Global program welcoming US startups
- Explicitly covers Regtech, Lending, Risk Analysis, Trading — all SolarOS strengths
- Past cohorts focused on carbon; solar tax equity compliance is an unserved gap
- Mentorship + customer acquisition + network (exactly what pre-seed needs)
- No equity taken
- 8-month program duration

**Application approach:**
- Position SolarOS as "the Regtech layer for solar tax equity" — a category that doesn't exist yet
- Emphasize the $50B+/year tax equity market software gap
- Show working product (not just a pitch deck)
- Highlight the 2026 market inflection: residential ITC expiration forced every deal through commercial tax credit compliance

**Contact**:
- Luna Zhang (Climate Fintech Associate) — 2024 program
- Austin Lu (austin.lu@newenergynexus.com) — 2023 program
- General inquiries via newenergynexus.com/contact-us/

### Program 2: CalSEED (SECONDARY TARGET)

**Why it could work:**
- Up to $700K non-dilutive funding ($150K concept + $450K prototype)
- Administered by New Energy Nexus — relationship building
- Explicitly accepts "hardware, software, or integrated solutions"
- Funded by California Energy Commission (EPIC program)

**Potential challenges:**
- Requires California address (Agentic Labs LLC — [Justin to confirm CA nexus])
- Under $1M in private funding (we qualify — bootstrapped)
- TRL 2-4 requirement — SolarOS may be TRL 5+ (working prototype/deployed)
- Technology focus areas for recent cohorts have been hardware-heavy (batteries, EV, electrification)
- Must benefit California ratepayers specifically

**Recommended approach:**
- Only apply if Justin has or can establish a California address
- Frame as "integrated solution" — software + data infrastructure for solar deployment
- Emphasize California ratepayer benefit: faster permitting = lower solar costs = lower bills
- Join mailing list at calseed.fund for next cohort announcement

### Program 3: The Clean Fight (New York) (MONITOR)

**Current programs open:**
- International Landing Pad (accepting applications) — for international companies entering US
- Affordable Housing Cohort
- Energy Storage Deployment
- Empire Technology Prize
- Deployment Grant Fund

**Assessment**: Limited direct fit. Clean Fight focuses on built environment decarbonization and physical deployment of climate tech. SolarOS is software/SaaS. However, if they expand to include "software enabling clean energy deployment," it could work. Worth monitoring.

> Solar industry veteran and software engineer who saw firsthand how broken the compliance and financing workflows are in residential solar. After the 2026 ITC expiration transformed every residential deal into a commercial tax credit transaction, I built SolarOS to automate the compliance verification that's now required on every single solar installation in America.

---

### Section 3: Problem Statement — Why Climate Fintech Needs Solar Compliance Infrastructure

**The $50 Billion Tax Equity Gap Has No Software Layer**

The Inflation Reduction Act created the largest clean energy financing mechanism in US history — transferable tax credits under Section 6418. In 2026 alone, the solar tax equity market will exceed $50 billion. But the financial infrastructure supporting these transactions is stuck in spreadsheets, email chains, and manual compliance verification.

Here is what changed on January 1, 2026:

1. **The residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired.** Homeowners can no longer claim a 30% federal tax credit for solar installations.

2. **Third-Party Ownership (TPO) became dominant overnight.** Because commercial entities can still claim the ITC, every residential solar deal now goes through a lease or PPA structure where a commercial tax equity investor owns the system.

3. **Every residential solar installation now requires commercial-grade tax credit compliance verification.** This includes:
   - FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) screening — panels and batteries cannot contain components from China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran
   - Domestic content verification — 50% US-manufactured threshold for the 10% bonus credit
   - Energy community eligibility — census tract verification for the 10% bonus
   - Prevailing wage and apprenticeship compliance for systems over 1 MW

4. **Massive tariffs (up to 3,400%) on Southeast Asian panels** created a compliance minefield. Installers must verify equipment origin for every project.

5. **The compliance verification process is entirely manual.** Tax equity investors, solar installers, TPO companies, and their lawyers are all duplicating compliance work on every deal — checking the same equipment specs, verifying the same census tracts, confirming the same domestic content percentages.

**The result:** A $50B+ market with no standardized compliance infrastructure. Every participant is building their own spreadsheets. Errors create recapture risk (the IRS can claw back credits). Insurance costs are rising because there's no reliable verification layer.

**This is a climate fintech problem, not just a solar problem.** Without reliable compliance infrastructure, tax equity capital flows slower, deals take longer, financing costs increase, and solar deployment decelerates — exactly when the world needs it to accelerate.

---

### Section 4: Solution — SolarOS as Climate Fintech Infrastructure

**SolarOS is the compliance and finance automation layer for the $50B+ solar tax equity market.**

We are building the Regtech infrastructure that connects solar installers, TPO companies, tax equity investors, and equipment manufacturers into a single compliance verification platform. Every actor in the solar financing chain needs the same data — equipment compliance status, energy community eligibility, domestic content percentages, and audit trails. SolarOS provides it through a unified platform and API.

#### Core Climate Fintech Capabilities

**1. Tax Equity Compliance Automation (Regtech)**

Our compliance engine provides real-time verification for every requirement that tax equity investors need before deploying capital:

- **FEOC Compliance Checking**: Automated screening of solar equipment (panels, inverters, batteries) against the Foreign Entity of Concern list. Our database tracks 72+ equipment products with compliance status, manufacturer origin, and tariff exposure.

- **Domestic Content Verification**: Automated calculation of US-manufactured content percentage against the 50% threshold required for the 10% ITC bonus credit. Equipment database tracks manufacturing origin at the component level.

- **Energy Community Bonus Credit Tracking**: Database of 147+ qualifying counties for the 10% ITC bonus. Instant census tract verification for any project address.

- **Equipment Tariff Compliance**: With AD/CVD tariffs up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels, our database identifies tariff-safe equipment and calculates tariff exposure for non-compliant products.

**2. TPO Facilitation (Lending/Finance)**

The shift to Third-Party Ownership (lease/PPA) created new financing workflow complexity that SolarOS automates:

- **Bankability Package Automation**: Compiling the document packages that TPO companies (Sunrun, Sunnova, etc.) and finance companies (GoodLeap, Palmetto, Mosaic, EverBright) require before funding a project. This includes production estimates, shade reports, equipment specs, permit approvals, and compliance certificates.

- **Solar Financing Workflow**: End-to-end tracking from customer qualification through funding disbursement, with automated document generation and compliance verification at each milestone.

- **Finance Product Matching**: Database of TPO providers and finance products across all 50 states, enabling installers to match customers with the optimal financing structure.

**3. Incentive Program Intelligence (Finance Automation)**

- **190+ incentive programs** across all 50 states tracked in real-time
- **485+ utility rate profiles** for accurate savings calculations
- **State-specific program eligibility** including community solar, low-income programs, battery incentives, and EV charging credits
- Automated incentive stacking to maximize customer savings and installer margins

**4. Tax Credit Marketplace Infrastructure (Trading)**

SolarOS is designed to become the verification layer for tax credit transfers under IRA Section 6418:

- **Credit Audit Engine**: Automated verification of every element required for tax credit transfer — equipment compliance, installation completion, interconnection, and permit approval. Full audit trail from day one.

- **Risk Assessment**: AI-powered risk scoring for tax credit transactions based on equipment provenance, installation quality (photo-verified), and compliance completeness.

- **Marketplace Foundation**: Platform architecture designed for credit listing, offer management, escrow (via Mercury ACH), and IRS transfer documentation.

**5. API Marketplace (B2B SaaS)**

All compliance and finance data is available through RESTful APIs, enabling integration with the existing solar ecosystem:

- Equipment compliance lookup
- Permit requirement queries
- Incentive program matching
- Utility rate data
- Full compliance reports
- Solar production estimates

Subscription tiers: Starter ($79/mo), Professional ($149/mo), Enterprise ($299/mo), plus pay-as-you-go options.

### Section 5: Climate Fintech Vertical Alignment

SolarOS maps directly to the eight climate fintech verticals defined in New Energy Nexus's foundational Climate Fintech Report:

#### Primary Verticals

**Regtech (Regulatory Technology)**
SolarOS is fundamentally a Regtech platform for clean energy finance. We automate compliance with:
- IRS tax credit requirements (Sections 48, 48E, 6418)
- FEOC screening (Section 40207 of IIJA)
- Domestic content rules (Notice 2023-38, updated 2025)
- State-level permitting requirements across 30,000+ jurisdictions
- Net metering / net billing transition compliance (varies by state)

No other platform provides automated, real-time compliance verification across all of these regulatory domains for solar installations.

**Lending**
Every residential solar installation in 2026 is a financed transaction. SolarOS automates the lending workflow:
- Customer qualification and credit pre-screening
- Finance product matching (lease vs. PPA vs. loan)
- Document package preparation for lenders
- Milestone tracking and funding disbursement triggers
- Integration planned with GoodLeap, Palmetto, Mosaic, and EverBright APIs

**Risk Analysis**
Tax equity investors need to assess risk before deploying capital. SolarOS provides:
- Equipment compliance risk scoring (FEOC, tariffs, domestic content)
- Installation quality verification (AI photo analysis with audit trail)
- Credit recapture risk assessment
- Energy community and bonus credit eligibility verification
- Historical compliance data for portfolio-level risk analysis

#### Secondary Verticals

**Trading**
IRA Section 6418 created a new market for transferable tax credits. SolarOS is designed to be the trusted verification layer:
- Credit audit and certification
- Marketplace listing and offer management
- Transaction escrow (Mercury ACH integration)
- IRS transfer documentation

**Insurtech**
Tax credit insurance is an emerging market. SolarOS's verification data feeds into:
- Risk assessment for insurance underwriting
- Audit trail documentation for claims
- Equipment provenance verification
- Installation quality scoring

**Investing**
Institutional investors deploying tax equity capital need reliable compliance data:
- Portfolio-level compliance monitoring
- Automated due diligence packages
- Real-time equipment compliance alerts
- Energy community eligibility tracking across investment portfolios

### Section 6: Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market (TAM): $4.2 Billion**
Total US solar soft costs — permitting, customer acquisition, compliance, and installation labor. Source: NREL soft cost benchmarking studies.

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $1.8 Billion**
Compliance verification, financing workflow automation, and tax credit transaction facilitation for US residential and commercial solar.

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $18 Million (Year 3)**
1% penetration of residential solar compliance verification market through API subscriptions and per-transaction fees.

**Why now — The 2026 Inflection Point:**

1. **Residential ITC expiration** (Jan 1, 2026): Every residential deal now requires commercial tax credit compliance verification. This created overnight demand for compliance automation.

2. **TPO dominance**: The shift from direct ownership to Third-Party Ownership means every residential solar installation is now a commercial financing transaction. More paperwork, more compliance requirements, more software needed.

3. **Tariff complexity**: AD/CVD tariffs up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels created a compliance minefield. Installers cannot afford to get this wrong.

4. **FEOC enforcement tightening**: The IRS is actively pursuing FEOC violations. Equipment screening is no longer optional.

5. **Tax credit transferability (Section 6418)**: A new $50B+ market for credit trading has emerged with no standardized compliance infrastructure.

6. **Installer margin squeeze**: With ITC gone for direct-to-consumer, installers must cut soft costs to survive. Software that reduces compliance time from hours to minutes has immediate ROI.

**Competitive Landscape:**

| Competitor | What They Do | Gap SolarOS Fills |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Crux Climate | Tax credit marketplace/brokerage | No integrated compliance engine; verification is manual |
| Basis Climate | Tax credit marketplace | Marketplace only; no upstream compliance data |
| Reunion Infrastructure | Tax equity structuring | Advisory/financial services, not software |
| Aurora Solar | Design + proposal | No tax credit compliance; acquired Lyra, closed ecosystem |
| GreenLancer | Human-powered permit engineering | Manual, $300-500/permit, no compliance automation |
| SolarAPP+ (NREL) | Instant permitting for participating jurisdictions | Free but limited scope; no compliance or financing |

**SolarOS differentiation**: We are the only platform combining national permit intelligence, real-time tax credit compliance verification, and financing workflow automation in a single API. We don't broker credits — we generate the compliance data that makes credits trustworthy.

### Section 8: Climate Impact

**Direct Impact: Accelerating Tax Equity Deployment**

Every day that a tax credit compliance verification takes is a day that tax equity capital isn't deployed. At current market friction levels:

- Average time for manual compliance verification: 8-15 hours per project
- SolarOS automated verification: Under 5 minutes per project
- Time saved per project: 7.5-15 hours of professional time
- Cost saved per project: $375-$750 (at $50/hr compliance staff rate)

**At scale:**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Projects with compliance automation | 5,000 | 50,000 | 250,000 |
| Tax equity capital accelerated | $150M | $1.5B | $7.5B |
| CO2 offset accelerated (metric tons) | 20,250 | 202,500 | 1,012,500 |
| Compliance cost savings | $2.5M | $25M | $125M |

**Calculation basis:**
- Average residential system: 8 kW
- Average system cost: $30,000
- Average annual production: 10,500 kWh
- US grid emission factor: 0.386 kg CO2/kWh (EPA eGRID)
- Annual CO2 offset per system: 4.05 metric tons
- 25-year lifetime CO2 offset per system: 101 metric tons

**Indirect Impact: Enabling Market Expansion**

By reducing compliance costs by $375-$750 per project, SolarOS makes solar financing economically viable for projects in markets with thinner margins — including low-income communities, rural areas, and smaller installers who cannot afford dedicated compliance staff.

The 10% energy community bonus credit (tracked for 147+ counties) and 10% domestic content bonus credit together can add $6,000+ to the value of a typical residential system. SolarOS ensures these bonuses are correctly claimed, maximizing the financial return that keeps the solar market growing.

**Equity Impact**

- Community solar programs in 24+ states benefit from streamlined compliance
- Low-income programs (LIHEAP-solar, DAC-SASH, Solar for All) have thinner margins that compliance cost reduction directly supports
- Energy community bonuses target disadvantaged areas — our tracking ensures these communities capture maximum value
- Smaller, community-based installers gain access to compliance infrastructure previously only available to large national players

### Section 10: Team

**Justin Griffith — Founder & CEO**
[Justin to add: 2-3 sentences about background, solar industry experience, and technical capabilities]

**AI-Augmented Development**
SolarOS is built using an AI-augmented development approach with Claude Code (Anthropic) and a custom AI agent system (Ava), enabling a solo founder to build and maintain a platform with the output of a much larger team. This isn't just our development methodology — it's our product philosophy: AI handles the systematic work, humans provide judgment and domain expertise. The same approach powers our compliance engine.

**Advisory Network**: [Justin to add any advisors, industry contacts, or planned hires]

**Hiring Plan (Post-Funding):**
1. Solar industry BD/partnerships lead (Q2 2026)
2. Full-stack engineer with fintech experience (Q3 2026)
3. Compliance/regulatory specialist (Q4 2026)

---

### Section 11: What We Want From the Climate Fintech Accelerator

**1. Financial Institution Connections**

The #1 thing that would accelerate SolarOS is warm introductions to tax equity investors, TPO companies, and solar finance platforms. These are our end users. Specific targets:
- Tax equity investors deploying capital into solar (JPMorgan, US Bank, Bank of America renewable energy groups)
- TPO companies (Sunrun, Sunnova, Freedom Solar, Palmetto)
- Solar finance platforms (GoodLeap, Mosaic, EverBright, Dividend Finance)
- Tax credit marketplace operators (Crux Climate, Basis) — potential partners, not just competitors

**2. Regtech Mentorship**

Navigating IRS regulations, Treasury guidance, and state-level compliance requirements requires deep regulatory expertise. We need mentors who understand:
- Tax credit structuring and transfer mechanics
- FEOC and domestic content regulatory trajectory
- Insurance and risk products for energy tax credits
- Cross-border compliance (for future international expansion)

**3. Go-to-Market Strategy for Regulated Finance**

Solar tax equity sits at the intersection of energy regulation, tax law, and financial services. We need guidance on:
- Selling compliance software to highly regulated financial institutions
- Building trust with tax equity investors who have billions at stake
- Positioning SolarOS as infrastructure vs. a point solution
- Partnership strategy: integrate with existing platforms vs. build direct channel

**4. Investor Readiness**

The 2026 market inflection created a massive opportunity, but communicating it to generalist climate tech investors requires translation. We need help:
- Framing the tax equity compliance gap as a venture-scale opportunity
- Building financial models that resonate with climate fintech investors
- Identifying the right investors for solar-specific fintech
- Preparing for seed round (target: $1.5-2M)

---

### Section 12: Vision — Where SolarOS Goes

**Year 1 (2026)**: Compliance API + permit intelligence platform. Revenue from API subscriptions and per-check fees. First paying customers among solar installers and small TPO companies.

**Year 2 (2027)**: Tax credit marketplace launch. Integration with major finance platforms (GoodLeap, Mosaic, EverBright). White-label compliance API for enterprise TPO companies. SREC/TREC market integration.

**Year 3 (2028)**: Full-stack solar finance infrastructure. Tax credit insurance partnerships. Community solar subscription management. International expansion (starting with markets that adopted similar ITC structures). AI-driven automated underwriting for solar loans.

**Long-term vision**: SolarOS becomes the "Plaid for solar finance" — the infrastructure layer that every solar financing transaction flows through. Just as Plaid became the standard API for bank account connectivity, SolarOS becomes the standard API for solar tax credit compliance and financing verification.

## OUTREACH EMAIL DRAFTS

### Email to Climate Fintech Accelerator Team

**Subject**: SolarOS — Solar Tax Equity Compliance Platform (Climate Fintech Accelerator Interest)

Dear Climate Fintech team,

I'm the founder of SolarOS, a compliance automation platform for the $50B+ solar tax equity market. I'm writing to express interest in the Climate Fintech Accelerator and to ask about the timeline for the next cohort.

SolarOS sits at the intersection of Regtech and Lending — we automate the compliance verification (FEOC screening, domestic content, energy community bonuses) and financing workflows that every residential solar installation now requires following the 2026 residential ITC expiration.

Quick overview:
- Working platform deployed with Stripe billing, API management, and national data coverage (106 jurisdictions, 50 states, 190+ incentive programs)
- RESTful API with 6 endpoints for equipment compliance, permits, incentives, and solar estimates
- Positioned as infrastructure for tax credit marketplace transactions under IRA Section 6418
- Pre-seed stage, bootstrapped, based in [CITY, STATE]

The 2026 ITC expiration created an overnight shift to Third-Party Ownership, meaning every residential solar deal now requires commercial tax credit compliance — a process that's currently 100% manual. SolarOS automates this.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how SolarOS fits the accelerator's focus areas. Are you currently accepting applications for the next cohort?

Best regards,
Justin Griffith
CEO & Founder, SolarOS (Agentic Labs LLC)

### Email to CalSEED Team

**Subject**: CalSEED Application Inquiry — Solar Compliance & Finance Automation Software

Dear CalSEED team,

I'm the founder of SolarOS, an AI-powered platform that automates solar tax credit compliance verification and financing workflows. I'm interested in applying to CalSEED and have a few questions about eligibility.

SolarOS is a software platform (with integrated data infrastructure) that reduces solar soft costs by automating the compliance verification process that every residential installation now requires following the 2026 ITC expiration. Our database covers 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states, 190+ incentive programs, and 72+ equipment products with FEOC and domestic content compliance tracking.

Questions:
1. Does CalSEED accept software-focused applications, or is the current cohort focused on hardware/integrated solutions?
2. Our platform is deployed and functional — would this be considered beyond TRL 4? Could we frame specific AI compliance engine components at TRL 3-4?
3. When is the next application window expected to open?

I'm based in [CITY, STATE] [note: mention CA connection if applicable].

Thank you,
Justin Griffith
