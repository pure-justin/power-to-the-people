## IMPORTANT CONTEXT: Political & Regulatory Landscape (Feb 2026)

Before reviewing individual programs, note these critical 2026 realities:

- **Residential ITC eliminated**: The federal residential solar tax credit (Section 25D) was repealed effective January 1, 2026 via the Working Families Tax Cut Act signed July 4, 2025.
- **SBIR/STTR lapsed**: Program authorization expired September 30, 2025. Congress has not yet reauthorized. Agencies cannot issue new Phase I awards until reauthorized. Bipartisan negotiations ongoing; expected resolution in early-mid 2026.
- **Solar for All ($7B) terminated**: EPA Administrator Zeldin announced August 7, 2025 that EPA will no longer administer the Solar for All program. Remaining funds rescinded. Legal challenges ongoing (Rhode Island AFL-CIO v. EPA).
- **EPA EJ Block Grants under threat**: ~781 IRA-funded environmental justice grants targeted for termination. Courts have issued mixed rulings.
- **DOE budget cuts**: FY2026 DOE solar program receives $220M, a 31% decrease from prior year. Budget reoriented toward nuclear and hard infrastructure.
- **IRA tax credits for commercial/TPO still active**: The commercial Investment Tax Credit (Section 48) and Production Tax Credit (Section 45) remain intact. Third-party ownership (lease/PPA) models now dominate residential since TPO entities can still claim the commercial ITC.

**Bottom line**: The federal landscape has shifted dramatically. Programs tied to EPA/IRA climate provisions are at risk. DOE programs are reduced but still operational. State programs and private accelerators are increasingly important. Software/technology companies should focus on SBIR (when reauthorized), NSF Seed Fund, state programs, and private accelerators.

## 1. DOE (Department of Energy) Programs

### 1.1 Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) Funding Opportunities

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Program** | SETO Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) |
| **Agency** | DOE Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) |
| **Funding** | Varies by FOA; historically $10M-$100M+ per solicitation |
| **Eligibility** | Industry, universities, national labs, state/local governments; collaborative partnerships encouraged |
| **Deadlines** | No FOAs currently open as of Feb 2026. Subscribe to SETO newsletter for announcements |
| **URL** | [energy.gov/eere/solar/funding-opportunities](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/funding-opportunities) |
| **Application Portal** | [EERE eXCHANGE](https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/) |
| **Qualification for Our Platform** | HIGH - SETO has historically funded solar soft costs reduction, permitting automation, and grid integration software. Our CRM with automated permitting and compliance checking aligns directly with SETO's soft costs reduction mission |
| **Priority** | 3/5 - Strong fit but no FOAs currently open; FY2026 budget reduced 31%; uncertain timeline for new solicitations |

**Key Context**: SETO addresses soft costs (permitting, siting, installation, interconnection, financing) which can represent up to 40% of total solar system cost. Our platform directly addresses this. Previous SETO programs like SolSmart and SolarAPP+ have funded exactly this type of work.

**Recent Relevant FOAs** (for reference on what they fund):
- STRIVES (Solar Technologies' Rapid Integration and Validation for Energy Systems)
- Advancing U.S. Thin-Film Solar PVs ($36M)
- ENERGISE (Enabling Extreme Real-Time Grid Integration of Solar Energy)

## 8. Recommended Strategy & Action Items

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Apply to Venture For ClimateTech** - Deadline Feb 20, 2026. $50K non-dilutive.
2. **Apply to Cleantech Open** - Window open now through Apr 6. $30 early bird fee by Feb 27.
3. **Identify SolarAPP+ jurisdictions** - Contact cities/counties receiving automated permitting grants in CA, MD, CO, MN, WA. Pitch our platform as their implementation solution.

### Short-Term (Next 2-3 Months)
4. **Draft DOE SBIR Phase I application** - Have materials ready for immediate submission when SBIR reauthorizes. Focus on solar soft costs reduction / automated permitting topic.
5. **Draft NSF SBIR Project Pitch** - Prepare for Energy Technologies topic. Submit when program reopens.
6. **Join National Community Solar Partnership** - Free membership; begin Phase 3 prize preparation (deadline Aug 12).
7. **Apply to Elemental Impact** - Monitor for 2026 cohort application window.

### Medium-Term (3-6 Months)
8. **Evaluate California presence** - If we can establish CA operations, CalSEED ($700K) and CalAPP partnerships become available.
9. **Subscribe to SETO newsletter** - Monitor for new FOAs that match our platform.
10. **Explore SBA 8(a) eligibility** - If ownership qualifies, this opens significant federal contracting opportunities.

### Strategic Positioning
- **Lead with automated permitting** - This is our strongest differentiator for government funding. SETO, SolarAPP+, and SBIR programs all prioritize reducing solar soft costs.
- **Emphasize energy community tools** - Community solar is a bipartisan priority and the Community Power Accelerator Prize is actively funded.
- **Position as infrastructure, not climate** - In the current political environment, frame our platform as reducing bureaucratic costs and streamlining American business processes rather than climate mitigation.
- **Partner with local governments** - Many programs fund jurisdictions, not companies. Position as the technology partner for government applicants.
