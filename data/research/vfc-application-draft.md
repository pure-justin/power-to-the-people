## COMPANY DESCRIPTION (Short — ~150 words)

SolarOS is an AI-powered platform that eliminates the #1 bottleneck to solar deployment in America: the fragmented, manual permitting process. While solar panel costs have dropped 90% in a decade, "soft costs" — permitting, inspection, and interconnection — now represent over 50% of total residential solar costs. With 30,000+ permitting jurisdictions in the US, each with different requirements, fees, timelines, and portals, installers waste an average of 20+ hours per project on paperwork instead of putting panels on roofs.

SolarOS automates the entire permit-to-install pipeline with a nationwide database of 106 jurisdictions (and growing), real-time compliance checking for domestic content and FEOC requirements, automated document generation, and AI-driven task routing that learns from every human action. When our AI can't handle something, it escalates to a human — then learns from what they did, getting smarter with every project.

## PROBLEM (What problem are you solving?)

**The solar industry has a deployment speed crisis, and it's not about the panels.**

Solar hardware costs have plummeted — but the US is still not deploying solar fast enough to meet climate goals. The bottleneck is soft costs:

- **Permitting alone costs $0.24/watt** (NREL), adding $1,920 to a typical 8 kW residential system
- **30,000+ jurisdictions** each have different requirements, fees, forms, and portals
- **Average permitting timeline: 2-8 weeks** depending on jurisdiction — some take months
- **Installers spend 20+ hours per project** on paperwork, compliance checks, and permit applications
- **New York's CLCPA target of 70% renewable by 2030 has already slipped to 2033** — the state auditor found the average large-scale siting process takes 3.7 years

The 2026 industry reset made this worse:
- The residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired January 1, 2026
- Tariffs up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels created compliance complexity
- Domestic content and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) requirements add new verification burdens
- The shift from direct ownership to Third-Party Ownership (lease/PPA) adds financing complexity

**Every day of permitting delay is a day a home isn't generating clean energy.** At scale, this means millions of tons of CO2 that could have been avoided.

---

## SOLUTION (How does your technology/product solve it?)

SolarOS is a full-stack solar deployment platform that automates the pipeline from customer qualification through permitting, compliance, and installation scheduling.

**Core capabilities:**

1. **National Permit Intelligence Database**
   - 106 city-level jurisdictions across all 50 states with fees, timelines, requirements, portal URLs, PE stamp thresholds, fire code requirements, and SolarAPP+ status
   - 50 state-level permit requirement documents covering interconnection, licensing, HOA restrictions, historic districts, and special considerations
   - Auto-updated from DSIRE, state energy offices, and municipal portals

2. **AI-Powered Compliance Engine**
   - Real-time domestic content verification (50% US threshold for 2026)
   - FEOC compliance checking (no China/Russia/NK/Iran components)
   - Tariff-safe equipment validation

## CLIMATE IMPACT (Quantify the carbon reduction potential)

### Direct Impact: Accelerating Solar Deployment

**Every month of permitting delay per project = 322 kg of CO2 that could have been offset.**

Calculation:
- Average US residential solar system: 8 kW
- Average annual production: 10,500 kWh
- US grid emission factor: 0.386 kg CO2/kWh (EPA eGRID 2024)
- Annual CO2 offset per system: 4,053 kg (4.05 metric tons)
- Per month: 338 kg CO2

**At scale (conservative projections):**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Projects accelerated | 1,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| Avg. time saved per project | 3 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |
| CO2 acceleration impact | 242 metric tons | 3,227 metric tons | 24,200 metric tons |
| Lifetime CO2 impact (25 yr) | 101,325 MT | 1,013,250 MT | 5,066,250 MT |

### Indirect Impact: Enabling Market Expansion

By reducing soft costs by $0.10-0.15/watt, SolarOS makes solar economically viable for an additional ~2 million US households currently on the margin. Each home that crosses the viability threshold represents ~100 metric tons of lifetime CO2 reduction.

### New York State Impact

- NY needs ~20 GW of solar to meet CLCPA targets (currently ~6 GW installed)
- Permitting delays are a recognized barrier — the state passed the RAPID Act to address siting bottlenecks
- SolarOS already covers 5 NY jurisdictions with detailed permit data
- Platform directly supports NY's goal of 70% renewable electricity
- Low-income solar programs (NY-Sun Affordable Solar) benefit from streamlined permitting — faster access for underserved communities

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY

**TAM**: $4.2B — Total US solar soft costs (permitting, customer acquisition, installation labor)
**SAM**: $1.2B — Permitting and compliance software/services for US residential solar
**SOM**: $12M — 1% of residential solar permits processed through SolarOS in Year 3

**Why now:**
1. **2026 industry reset** created massive compliance complexity (domestic content, FEOC, tariffs) that manual processes can't handle
2. **Residential ITC expiration** squeezes margins — installers must cut soft costs to survive
3. **SolarAPP+ adoption** proves the market wants automated permitting (500+ jurisdictions, DOE-backed)
4. **TPO shift** means every residential deal now involves commercial tax credit compliance — more paperwork, more errors, more delays

**Competitive landscape:**
- SolarAPP+ (NREL): Free but limited to standard residential, requires jurisdiction adoption
- Symbium: AI zoning/permitting, 200+ jurisdictions, government-facing
- Lyra Solar (Aurora): Acquired, closed ecosystem
- GreenLancer: Human-powered permit engineering ($300-500/permit)

**Our differentiation:** SolarOS is the only platform combining a national permit database, real-time compliance engine, and self-improving AI task routing in a single open API. We don't just tell you what the requirements are — we help you meet them automatically.

## NEW YORK STATE CONNECTION

SolarOS has direct alignment with New York's climate infrastructure needs:

1. **CLCPA Compliance**: NY's 70% renewable target (now 2033) requires dramatically faster solar deployment. Permitting automation directly addresses the deployment speed gap identified by the state auditor.

2. **RAPID Act Alignment**: NY passed the RAPID Act specifically to streamline renewable energy siting. SolarOS complements this by automating the residential/commercial permitting that RAPID doesn't cover.

3. **NY-Sun & Affordable Solar**: Low-income solar programs benefit disproportionately from permitting automation — reduced soft costs make projects viable for communities currently priced out.

4. **Fastest Permitting Baseline**: NY already has the fastest average solar approval timeline (25 days). SolarOS can help maintain and extend this lead while other states catch up.

5. **Market Presence**: [Justin to confirm — any NY-based operations, partnerships, or willingness to establish NY presence]

## UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

SolarOS directly enables equitable solar access:

1. **Reducing soft costs** disproportionately benefits low-income communities where project margins are already thin
2. **Community solar enablement** — our national permit and incentive database includes community solar programs in 24+ states
3. **Energy community bonus credits** — we track 147+ qualifying counties for the IRS 10% bonus, many in disadvantaged areas
4. **Low-income program integration** — our database includes LIHEAP-solar pathways, DAC-SASH, Solar for All alternatives, and state-specific LMI programs
5. **Language-accessible automation** — reducing the expertise barrier for smaller, community-based installers who can't afford compliance consultants

---

## WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET FROM THE PROGRAM? (~200 words)

**Three things would be transformative for SolarOS:**

1. **Municipal & utility partnerships**: We need warm introductions to jurisdiction building departments, utility interconnection teams, and state energy offices — especially in New York. Our platform is only as good as the relationships that keep our permit database current and enable API integration with permitting portals.

2. **Go-to-market strategy for a regulated industry**: Solar permitting sits at the intersection of government, utilities, and private industry. We need mentorship from people who've navigated selling into this ecosystem — particularly the decision to sell directly to installers vs. through existing platforms (Aurora, Enerflo, etc.) vs. to municipalities.

3. **Investor readiness**: We have a working product and a massive addressable market, but we need coaching on how to tell this story to climate tech investors. The 2026 industry reset has created both urgency (margins squeezed, compliance complexity exploded) and opportunity (the companies that solve soft costs win). We need help translating that into a fundable narrative.

The cohort's focus on New York is particularly valuable — NY is our #1 target market given CLCPA targets, the RAPID Act, and the state's existing leadership in fast permitting.
