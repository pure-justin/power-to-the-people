## Founder Information

**Founder**: Justin Griffith
**Title**: CEO & Founder
**Email**: justin@agntc.tech
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-griffith-86030013b/
**Background**: CEO and Owner of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies, covering most of the state with peak annual revenue of $100M. Built SolarOS from direct, at-scale experience with the permitting bottleneck that costs the solar industry billions annually. After years of watching his own teams spend more time on paperwork than installations, Justin built the platform to solve the problem he lived every day -- automating permitting, compliance, and the entire deployment pipeline using AI.

---

## COMPANY DESCRIPTION (Short — ~150 words)

SolarOS is an AI-powered platform that eliminates the #1 bottleneck to solar deployment in America: the fragmented, manual permitting process. While solar panel costs have dropped 90% in a decade, "soft costs" — permitting, inspection, and interconnection — now represent over 50% of total residential solar costs. With 30,000+ permitting jurisdictions in the US, each with different requirements, fees, timelines, and portals, installers waste an average of 20+ hours per project on paperwork instead of putting panels on roofs.

SolarOS automates the entire permit-to-install pipeline with a nationwide database of 106 jurisdictions (and growing), real-time compliance checking for domestic content and FEOC requirements, automated document generation, and AI-driven task routing that learns from every human action. When our AI can't handle something, it escalates to a human — then learns from what they did, getting smarter with every project.

---

## PROBLEM (What problem are you solving?)

**The solar industry has a deployment speed crisis, and it's not about the panels.**

Solar hardware costs have plummeted — but the US is still not deploying solar fast enough to meet climate goals. The bottleneck is soft costs:

- **Permitting alone costs $0.24/watt** (NREL), adding $1,920 to a typical 8 kW residential system
- **30,000+ jurisdictions** each have different requirements, fees, forms, and portals
- **Average permitting timeline: 2-8 weeks** depending on jurisdiction — some take months
- **Installers spend 20+ hours per project** on paperwork, compliance checks, and permit applications
- **New York's CLCPA target of 70% renewable by 2030 has already slipped to 2033** — the state auditor found the average large-scale siting process takes 3.7 years

The 2026 industry reset made this worse:
- The residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC) expired January 1, 2026
- Tariffs up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels created compliance complexity
- Domestic content and FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) requirements add new verification burdens
- The shift from direct ownership to Third-Party Ownership (lease/PPA) adds financing complexity

**Every day of permitting delay is a day a home isn't generating clean energy.** At scale, this means millions of tons of CO2 that could have been avoided.

---

## SOLUTION (How does your technology/product solve it?)

SolarOS is a full-stack solar deployment platform that automates the pipeline from customer qualification through permitting, compliance, and installation scheduling.

**Core capabilities:**

1. **National Permit Intelligence Database**
   - 106 city-level jurisdictions across all 50 states with fees, timelines, requirements, portal URLs, PE stamp thresholds, fire code requirements, and SolarAPP+ status
   - 50 state-level permit requirement documents covering interconnection, licensing, HOA restrictions, historic districts, and special considerations
   - Auto-updated from DSIRE, state energy offices, and municipal portals

2. **AI-Powered Compliance Engine**
   - Real-time domestic content verification (50% US threshold for 2026)
   - FEOC compliance checking (no China/Russia/NK/Iran components)
   - Tariff-safe equipment validation
   - Equipment database with 72+ products tracked for compliance status

## CLIMATE IMPACT (Quantify the carbon reduction potential)

### Direct Impact: Accelerating Solar Deployment

**Every month of permitting delay per project = 322 kg of CO2 that could have been offset.**

Calculation:
- Average US residential solar system: 8 kW
- Average annual production: 10,500 kWh
- US grid emission factor: 0.386 kg CO2/kWh (EPA eGRID 2024)
- Annual CO2 offset per system: 4,053 kg (4.05 metric tons)
- Per month: 338 kg CO2

**At scale (conservative projections):**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Projects accelerated | 1,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| Avg. time saved per project | 3 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |
| CO2 acceleration impact | 242 metric tons | 3,227 metric tons | 24,200 metric tons |
| Lifetime CO2 impact (25 yr) | 101,325 MT | 1,013,250 MT | 5,066,250 MT |

### Indirect Impact: Enabling Market Expansion

By reducing soft costs by $0.10-0.15/watt, SolarOS makes solar economically viable for an additional ~2 million US households currently on the margin. Each home that crosses the viability threshold represents ~100 metric tons of lifetime CO2 reduction.

### New York State Impact

- NY needs ~20 GW of solar to meet CLCPA targets (currently ~6 GW installed)
- Permitting delays are a recognized barrier — the state passed the RAPID Act to address siting bottlenecks
- SolarOS already covers 5 NY jurisdictions with detailed permit data
- Platform directly supports NY's goal of 70% renewable electricity
- Low-income solar programs (NY-Sun Affordable Solar) benefit from streamlined permitting — faster access for underserved communities

---

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY

**TAM**: $4.2B — Total US solar soft costs (permitting, customer acquisition, installation labor)
**SAM**: $1.2B — Permitting and compliance software/services for US residential solar
**SOM**: $12M — 1% of residential solar permits processed through SolarOS in Year 3

**Why now:**
1. **2026 industry reset** created massive compliance complexity (domestic content, FEOC, tariffs) that manual processes can't handle
2. **Residential ITC expiration** squeezes margins — installers must cut soft costs to survive
3. **SolarAPP+ adoption** proves the market wants automated permitting (500+ jurisdictions, DOE-backed)
4. **TPO shift** means every residential deal now involves commercial tax credit compliance — more paperwork, more errors, more delays

**Competitive landscape:**
- SolarAPP+ (NREL): Free but limited to standard residential, requires jurisdiction adoption
- Symbium: AI zoning/permitting, 200+ jurisdictions, government-facing
- Lyra Solar (Aurora): Acquired, closed ecosystem
- GreenLancer: Human-powered permit engineering ($300-500/permit)

**Our differentiation:** SolarOS is the only platform combining a national permit database, real-time compliance engine, and self-improving AI task routing in a single open API. We don't just tell you what the requirements are — we help you meet them automatically.

## TEAM

**Justin Griffith — Founder & CEO**
Owner and CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar installation companies, covering most of the state with peak annual revenue of $100M. Justin didn't read about the solar permitting problem in a report — he lived it at scale, managing thousands of installations across dozens of Texas jurisdictions. That direct experience with the bottleneck is what drove him to build SolarOS: the platform he wished existed when his teams were spending more time fighting paperwork than installing panels.

Justin combines rare dual expertise: deep operational knowledge of solar installation at scale (permitting workflows, municipal relationships, equipment compliance, installer economics) with technical execution capability. He built the entire SolarOS platform using AI-augmented development, proving the same AI-first philosophy that powers the product.

**Pure Energy Network**: Through Pure Energy's statewide operations, SolarOS has direct access to installer feedback, municipal permitting relationships, and real-world validation data from thousands of completed projects. This isn't a founder building from theory — it's a $100M/year operator building the tool the industry needs.

**AI Co-Development**: SolarOS is built with Claude Code (Anthropic) and a custom AI agent system (Ava), enabling a solo technical founder to ship at the velocity of a 10-person team. This is the same AI-first pattern that powers SolarOS's self-learning task engine: AI does the work, humans provide judgment.

## NEW YORK STATE CONNECTION

SolarOS has direct alignment with New York's climate infrastructure needs:

1. **CLCPA Compliance**: NY's 70% renewable target (now 2033) requires dramatically faster solar deployment. Permitting automation directly addresses the deployment speed gap identified by the state auditor.

2. **RAPID Act Alignment**: NY passed the RAPID Act specifically to streamline renewable energy siting. SolarOS complements this by automating the residential/commercial permitting that RAPID doesn't cover.

3. **NY-Sun & Affordable Solar**: Low-income solar programs benefit disproportionately from permitting automation — reduced soft costs make projects viable for communities currently priced out.

4. **Fastest Permitting Baseline**: NY already has the fastest average solar approval timeline (25 days). SolarOS can help maintain and extend this lead while other states catch up.

5. **Market Expansion**: SolarOS is currently based in San Antonio, TX — the heart of the ERCOT market and one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the US. We are actively expanding our jurisdiction coverage to New York (5 NY jurisdictions already in database) and are committed to establishing NY market presence through the program. The VFC cohort would provide the connections and ecosystem access to accelerate our NY expansion.

---

## UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

SolarOS directly enables equitable solar access:

1. **Reducing soft costs** disproportionately benefits low-income communities where project margins are already thin
2. **Community solar enablement** — our national permit and incentive database includes community solar programs in 24+ states
3. **Energy community bonus credits** — we track 147+ qualifying counties for the IRS 10% bonus, many in disadvantaged areas
4. **Low-income program integration** — our database includes LIHEAP-solar pathways, DAC-SASH, Solar for All alternatives, and state-specific LMI programs
5. **Language-accessible automation** — reducing the expertise barrier for smaller, community-based installers who can't afford compliance consultants

---

## WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO GET FROM THE PROGRAM? (~200 words)

**Three things would be transformative for SolarOS:**

1. **Municipal & utility partnerships**: We need warm introductions to jurisdiction building departments, utility interconnection teams, and state energy offices — especially in New York. Our platform is only as good as the relationships that keep our permit database current and enable API integration with permitting portals.

2. **Go-to-market strategy for a regulated industry**: Solar permitting sits at the intersection of government, utilities, and private industry. We need mentorship from people who've navigated selling into this ecosystem — particularly the decision to sell directly to installers vs. through existing platforms (Aurora, Enerflo, etc.) vs. to municipalities.

3. **Investor readiness**: We have a working product and a massive addressable market, but we need coaching on how to tell this story to climate tech investors. The 2026 industry reset has created both urgency (margins squeezed, compliance complexity exploded) and opportunity (the companies that solve soft costs win). We need help translating that into a fundable narrative.

The cohort's focus on New York is particularly valuable — NY is our #1 target market given CLCPA targets, the RAPID Act, and the state's existing leadership in fast permitting.

## VFC APPLICATION STRATEGY NOTES

### Why SolarOS Is a Strong Cohort 6 Candidate

1. **Climate impact is quantifiable**: 338 kg CO2/month per project accelerated. At scale, 5M+ metric tons lifetime impact.
2. **NYS alignment is natural**: NY has the fastest permitting baseline (25 days avg), CLCPA targets, the RAPID Act, and NY-Sun programs that all benefit from automation.
3. **Stage fit is perfect**: TRL 5-6 with working platform, but pre-revenue and pre-seed. Exactly what VFC targets.
4. **Founder credibility is exceptional**: $100M/yr solar company CEO building the tool he needed. Not theoretical.
5. **Diversity of impact**: Benefits small community-based installers, LMI communities, and enables community solar.
6. **The $50K will go far**: Small team, AI-augmented development, focused use of funds on NY market entry.

### Key Messaging for F6S Form

- **Lead with the operator story**: "I run a $100M solar company. I built the tool I wish existed."
- **Quantify the climate cost of delay**: Every month of permitting delay = 338 kg CO2 per project.
- **Show the NYS angle**: 5 NY jurisdictions already in database, CLCPA alignment, RAPID Act complement.
- **Demonstrate the working product**: Link to https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app
- **The 2026 inflection**: ITC expiration + tariff chaos + FEOC requirements created the moment for this platform.

### Weak Points to Address Proactively

- **Location**: Based in TX, not NY. Mitigate: "Permitting is a national problem with state-specific solutions. SolarOS already covers 5 NY jurisdictions and is committed to NY market expansion. The VFC cohort provides the connections to accelerate this."
- **Solo founder**: Mitigate: "Pure Energy provides a built-in team of domain experts. AI-augmented development enables solo founder velocity. First hires planned with seed funding."
- **Pre-revenue**: Mitigate: "Revenue model validated with Stripe billing. Pure Energy serves as first pilot customer. Platform is deployed and functional."

### Video Pitch Script (2 minutes)

"Hi, I'm Justin Griffith. I'm the CEO of Pure Energy, one of the largest residential solar companies in Texas, with peak revenue of $100 million a year.

I've managed thousands of solar installations across dozens of jurisdictions. And the biggest problem I face every single day isn't the panels or the inverters -- it's the paperwork. Every city has different permitting rules, different forms, different fees, different portals. My teams spend more time navigating bureaucracy than installing solar.

And it just got worse. In January 2026, the residential tax credit expired. Massive tariffs hit Southeast Asian panels. New domestic content and FEOC requirements created a compliance nightmare. Every deal now requires commercial-grade verification that used to be unnecessary.

So I built SolarOS -- the operating system for solar installation. It's an AI-powered platform with a national permit database covering 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states, a real-time compliance engine, and a self-learning AI that gets smarter with every project.

For New York specifically, SolarOS directly supports the CLCPA goals. We already have 5 New York jurisdictions in our database. Faster permitting means faster clean energy deployment for the state.

The climate math is simple: every month of permitting delay on a single project means 338 kilograms of CO2 that could have been avoided. Multiply that across thousands of projects and years of delay, and you're talking about millions of tons.

SolarOS is live, functional, and ready for pilot deployment. I'm looking for the VFC program to help me enter the New York market and connect with the investor ecosystem to scale nationally.

Thank you."
