## Company Overview

SolarOS is an AI-powered solar deployment platform that automates permitting, compliance verification, and installation pipeline management for the $50B+ U.S. residential solar market. Built by the CEO of a $100M Texas solar installation company, SolarOS eliminates the operational chaos that drives up soft costs and delays projects across all 50 states.

## The Problem

Soft costs -- permitting, compliance, interconnection, and project management -- now account for over 60% of total residential solar installation costs in the United States, more than the hardware itself. The root cause: a fragmented regulatory landscape where every municipality has different permitting requirements, every utility has different interconnection rules, and federal compliance rules (domestic content, FEOC, tariffs) change constantly.

**The result:**
- Solar companies waste hundreds of hours per year navigating inconsistent local requirements
- Permitting delays add weeks to project timelines and thousands in carrying costs
- Compliance errors risk clawback of federal tax credits worth 30%+ of project value
- Small and mid-size installers cannot scale because operations do not scale

The 2026 market reset has made this worse: the residential ITC expired, third-party ownership models now dominate (requiring commercial-grade compliance), and tariffs of up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels have upended the equipment landscape.

## The Solution

SolarOS provides the operational intelligence layer for solar deployment:

| Capability | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **National Permit Database** | 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states -- requirements, fees, timelines, contacts |
| **AI Compliance Engine** | Real-time verification of domestic content (50% US threshold), FEOC (no China/Russia/NK/Iran), and tariff exposure |
| **Incentive Intelligence** | 190+ federal, state, and local incentive programs tracked and matched to projects |
| **Utility Rate Library** | 485+ utility rate structures for accurate savings calculations |
| **Equipment Database** | 72+ panels, inverters, and batteries with compliance scoring |
| **API Marketplace** | 6 RESTful endpoints with Stripe subscription billing -- embed SolarOS data in any workflow |
| **Self-Learning AI Engine** | AI attempts tasks autonomously; human fallback when needed; system learns from every interaction |

## Market Opportunity

- **U.S. residential solar market:** $50B+ annually
- **Soft cost crisis:** 60%+ of total installation cost is non-hardware
- **Total addressable market for permitting/compliance software:** $2B+ (10,000+ solar installers, EPCs, financiers)
- **2026 tailwinds:** Residential ITC expiration forces shift to TPO models requiring rigorous compliance infrastructure; tariff chaos creates demand for equipment compliance verification; net metering-to-net billing transitions require accurate utility rate intelligence
- **Competitive landscape:** Aurora Solar (design), GreenLite (municipal-side permitting), Scoop Solar (field ops) -- no one owns the compliance and permitting intelligence layer from the installer's perspective
