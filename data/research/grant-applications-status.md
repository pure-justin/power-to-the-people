## STRATEGIC NOTES

### Immediate ROI Actions (This Week)
1. **VFC submission** -- highest ROI action. $50K non-dilutive, NYSERDA backing, Climate Week NYC showcase. Draft is complete. Just needs F6S account + submission.
2. **Blue Bear deal form** -- 5 minutes to submit. Lowest friction VC outreach.
3. **Cleantech Open registration** -- $30 early bird. Gets you into the accelerator pipeline.

### Maximum Non-Dilutive Funding Path
VFC ($50K) + CalSEED ($700K) + Cleantech Open ($150K) + NSF SBIR ($280K) = **$1.18M non-dilutive**
This would fund 18-24 months of operations without giving up equity.

### Fastest Path to VC Funding
1. Submit VFC + get accepted (validation signal)
2. Submit Blue Bear deal form (immediate)
3. Email Congruent investors@congruentvc.com (best stage fit)
4. Climate Week NYC showcase (September 2026) for warm investor intros
