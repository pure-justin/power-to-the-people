## Long Bio (300 words)

Justin Griffith is the CEO and owner of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar installation companies, where he has managed thousands of solar installations across dozens of Texas jurisdictions and scaled the business to peak annual revenue of $100 million. Over the course of building Pure Energy into a statewide operation covering most of Texas, Justin developed deep expertise in the operational bottlenecks that plague solar deployment: inconsistent municipal permitting requirements, shifting federal compliance rules, fragmented utility rate structures, and the slow, manual processes that drive up soft costs across the industry.

In 2025, Justin founded Agentic Labs LLC to build SolarOS, an AI-powered solar deployment platform designed to solve these problems at scale. SolarOS automates the entire solar installation pipeline -- from permitting and compliance verification to equipment selection and incentive optimization. The platform maintains a national permit database covering 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states, an AI compliance engine that verifies domestic content, FEOC, and tariff requirements in real time, and comprehensive tracking of 190+ incentive programs, 485+ utility rates, and 72+ equipment products.

What makes SolarOS distinctive is its origin: it was built by an operator who lived the problem. Justin's relationships with solar installers and municipal permitting offices across Texas gave him the domain knowledge that no purely technical founder could replicate. He then applied AI-augmented development techniques to build the platform as a solo technical founder, creating a self-learning AI task engine that improves with every interaction.

As the solar industry navigates the 2026 market reset -- with the residential ITC expiration, the shift to third-party ownership models, and massive tariffs reshaping the equipment landscape -- SolarOS provides the compliance and operational infrastructure that installers, developers, and financiers need to operate profitably in the new environment.

Justin is based in San Antonio, Texas.
