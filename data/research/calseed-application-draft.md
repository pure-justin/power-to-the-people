### 2024 Technology Areas (Cohort 7)

The 2024 cohort focused on four areas. These CHANGE EACH YEAR. The next cohort may include different areas. Based on CalSEED's history and California's priorities, solar/clean energy software has been eligible in past cohorts. Key consideration: our application must align with whatever technology areas are announced for Cohort 8.

- Battery Circularity
- Long Duration Energy Storage
- Medium/Heavy-Duty Vehicle Electrification
- End-use Electrification

**IMPORTANT**: Past cohorts have included broader categories like "clean energy generation" and "efficiency" that would fit SolarOS. CalSEED explicitly accepts **software** as a technology type: "Digital technology using data science/machine learning for grid planning/operation." SolarOS fits this definition.

### Evaluation Criteria (Three Dimensions)

Applications are scored by a review committee of industry experts and California energy agency representatives on:

1. **Innovation** -- Technical quality, novelty, and potential of the proposed technology
2. **Social Impact & Energy Equity** -- Benefits to disadvantaged/low-income communities, pollution reduction, economic opportunities, resilience
3. **Team & Approach** -- Qualifications, capabilities, and execution plan

### Selection Process

- ~100 applications per cohort (Cohort 7 had 97)
- Initial screening reduces to ~28 full applications
- Most common disqualification: misalignment with targeted technology areas
- 5-month selection process from application to final selection
- 17-20 Concept Awards per cohort

### Past Solar & Software Awardees

### SECTION 2: TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION

#### 2A. What is your innovation? Describe the technology, product, or process you are developing. (~500 words)

SolarOS is an AI-powered solar deployment platform that automates the permitting, compliance, and project management pipeline for residential and commercial solar installations across the United States, with particular focus on California.

The core innovation is a self-learning AI task engine combined with a national permit intelligence database. The platform addresses the single largest barrier to solar deployment: the fragmented, manual process of navigating 30,000+ permitting jurisdictions, each with different requirements, fees, timelines, forms, and submission portals.

**Architecture & Key Technical Components:**

1. **National Permit Intelligence Database**: A comprehensive, structured database covering 106 city-level jurisdictions across all 50 states. For each jurisdiction, we capture permit fees, processing timelines, required documents (structural engineering, single-line diagrams, load calculations, site plans), portal URLs, PE stamp thresholds, fire code requirements, HOA restrictions, and SolarAPP+ adoption status. Seven California jurisdictions are already fully documented: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Sacramento, Fresno, and Long Beach.

2. **AI Compliance Engine**: A real-time verification system for the complex regulatory landscape created by the 2026 federal policy changes. The engine validates domestic content compliance (50% US manufacturing threshold), FEOC (Foreign Entity of Concern) compliance, and tariff exposure across a database of 72+ solar equipment products. This is critical for California installers navigating the shift from direct ownership to third-party ownership (TPO), where commercial tax credit compliance requirements are now mandatory for every residential deal.

3. **Self-Learning AI Task Engine**: A novel architecture where AI attempts every task first (permit document generation, compliance verification, cost estimation). When the AI cannot complete a task with sufficient confidence, it escalates to a human operator with full context. When the human completes the task, the system captures the pattern -- the input, the human decision, and the outcome -- as structured learning data. Over time, the AI automates an increasing share of tasks. Every human action inside the platform becomes training data for future automation.

4. **Solar Data API Marketplace**: Six RESTful HTTP endpoints providing programmatic access to equipment data, utility rates (485+ profiles), incentive programs (190+ programs), permit requirements, compliance checks, and full solar estimates. The API is designed for integration with existing solar platforms (Aurora Solar, Enerflo, OpenSolar) via subscription billing at three tiers ($79/$149/$299 per month).

**Technology Type**: Software -- digital technology using data science and machine learning for solar deployment planning, permitting automation, and regulatory compliance verification.

**Current State**: Working prototype deployed in production at https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app with a live Firestore database, functioning API endpoints, Stripe-integrated subscription billing, Twilio SMS notifications, and Mercury ACH invoicing.

---

#### 2B. What is the current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of your innovation? Explain. (~200 words)

SolarOS is at **TRL 4: Component/subsystem validation in laboratory environment** with elements of TRL 3.

**TRL 3 elements (Proof-of-Concept Validated):**
- The AI task engine architecture has been designed, documented, and partially implemented with the core escalation and learning data capture patterns validated
- The compliance engine logic has been proven against real equipment data and real jurisdictional requirements

**TRL 4 elements (Component Validation):**
- The permit intelligence database is populated with 106 real jurisdictions and validated against actual municipal data sources
- The Solar Data API has been built and tested with full-scale data: 485+ utility rate profiles, 190+ incentive programs, 72+ equipment products
- The subscription billing system is integrated and functional with Stripe
- The platform is deployed and accessible in a production environment
- End-to-end workflows (lead creation, compliance check, solar estimate, permit lookup) have been tested with representative data

**What CalSEED funding would advance:** The Concept Award would fund the transition from TRL 4 to TRL 5-6 by enabling live pilot deployments with California solar installers, integration with SolarAPP+ for automated permit submission in adopted jurisdictions, and refinement of the AI learning engine with real-world project data.

---

#### 2C. What is the primary problem your innovation solves? (~300 words)

**Solar deployment in California and nationwide is bottlenecked not by technology, but by paperwork.**

Solar panel hardware costs have fallen over 90% in the past decade. Yet the US is not deploying solar fast enough to meet state and federal climate targets. The bottleneck is "soft costs" -- the non-hardware expenses that now represent over 50% of total residential solar installation costs (NREL).

Permitting alone adds significant cost per watt to every residential installation. With 30,000+ permitting jurisdictions nationwide, each with different requirements, fees, forms, and portals, installers spend an average of 20+ hours per project on paperwork, compliance verification, and permit applications. This is time and money not spent putting panels on rooftops.

**For California specifically, this problem is acute and policy-relevant:**

- California's SB 379 (2022) mandates that most jurisdictions implement automated online permitting platforms (like SolarAPP+). Yet compliance is uneven, and many jurisdictions still use manual processes, creating a patchwork that frustrates installers.

- California's AB 2188 requires streamlined permitting for small residential solar systems, including electronic submission and published checklists. Enforcement varies widely.

- California needs an additional 40+ GW of solar to meet its 2045 100% clean energy target. Every month of permitting delay across thousands of projects represents enormous aggregate CO2 that goes unabated.

**The 2026 federal policy changes compounded this:**
The residential Investment Tax Credit expired January 1, 2026, squeezing installer margins. Simultaneously, tariffs up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian panels and new domestic content and FEOC compliance requirements have added layers of verification complexity that manual processes simply cannot handle at scale.

The result: California's solar industry needs to do more work, with less margin, under more complex rules, faster than ever before. SolarOS provides the automation infrastructure to make that possible.

---

#### 2D. Describe the competitive landscape. How is your approach different from existing solutions? (~300 words)

The solar permitting and compliance space has several players, but no single platform combines national permit intelligence, real-time compliance verification, and self-learning AI in an open API architecture.

**Existing Solutions & Gaps:**

| Competitor | Approach | Limitation |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **SolarAPP+** (NREL/DOE) | Free automated permitting platform for jurisdictions | Requires individual jurisdiction adoption. Only covers standard residential. Does not address compliance, equipment verification, or project management. ~500 jurisdictions adopted, but >29,000 have not. |
| **Symbium** | AI-powered zoning and permitting analysis for 200+ jurisdictions | Government-facing, not installer-facing. Focused on zoning/entitlement, not solar-specific compliance. Closed platform. |
| **Lyra Solar** (acquired by Aurora) | Permit engineering within Aurora's design platform | Closed ecosystem. Only available to Aurora customers. Does not provide API access or work with other solar platforms. |
| **GreenLancer** | Human-powered permit engineering ($300-500/permit) | Expensive, does not scale, no AI learning, no compliance engine. Manual labor model with no automation trajectory. |
| **OpenSolar / Enerflo** | Solar sales and design platforms | Include some permit tracking but lack comprehensive jurisdictional data, compliance engines, or automated submission capabilities. |

**SolarOS Differentiation:**

1. **Open API architecture**: Unlike closed ecosystems, SolarOS provides RESTful API access so any solar platform, installer, or developer can integrate our permit intelligence and compliance data.

2. **National + deep**: 106 jurisdictions with granular data (fees, timelines, PE thresholds, fire codes, SolarAPP+ status) across all 50 states, with 7 California jurisdictions at detailed depth.

3. **Self-learning AI**: The human-flywheel model where every human action becomes training data is architecturally distinct from static rule engines or pure-human services.

4. **Full compliance stack**: Domestic content, FEOC, tariff exposure, and equipment verification in a single engine -- a capability no competitor currently offers as an integrated service.

5. **Installer-first**: Designed for the people who actually pull permits, not for jurisdictions or platform vendors.

### SECTION 3: CALIFORNIA RATEPAYER BENEFITS

#### 3A. How does your innovation benefit California electricity ratepayers? (~300 words)

SolarOS delivers direct, measurable benefits to California ratepayers through three mechanisms:

**1. Reduced Solar Installation Costs**

Permitting and compliance represent a significant portion of solar soft costs. By automating permit document preparation, compliance verification, and jurisdictional navigation, SolarOS reduces the time and labor cost per installation. These savings flow directly to ratepayers as lower solar system prices, making solar accessible to more California households -- particularly low- and moderate-income households where project economics are already marginal.

For a typical 8 kW residential system in California, reducing soft costs by even $0.10/watt saves $800 per installation. Across California's 400,000+ annual residential solar installations, this represents hundreds of millions in aggregate ratepayer savings.

**2. Faster Solar Deployment = Lower Grid Costs**

Every solar installation that comes online faster reduces California's dependence on natural gas peaker plants, which are the most expensive generation source on the grid. By accelerating permitting timelines from weeks to days, SolarOS increases the rate at which distributed generation offsets peak demand, directly reducing the wholesale electricity costs that California utilities pass to ratepayers.

**3. Supporting AB 2188 & SB 379 Compliance**

California has already mandated streamlined solar permitting (AB 2188) and automated online permitting platforms (SB 379). SolarOS provides the underlying data infrastructure and AI automation that jurisdictions need to comply with these mandates. By making compliance easier, we accelerate the transition from paper-based to automated permitting statewide, which benefits every ratepayer who wants to install solar.

**Reliability & Safety Benefits:**

- Compliance engine ensures equipment meets safety standards (fire code, structural requirements) before permits are submitted, reducing installation errors
- Automated document generation reduces human error in permit applications, leading to fewer rejections and re-inspections
- Grid-interactive data enables better planning for distributed energy integration

---

#### 3B. How does your innovation address energy equity? Identify how it could create economic opportunities, increase access to clean energy, decrease pollution, deploy in disadvantaged communities, or improve resilience. (~400 words)

**1. Creating Economic Opportunities**

SolarOS reduces the expertise barrier for small and community-based solar installers who cannot afford in-house permit engineers or compliance consultants. By providing AI-powered permit preparation and compliance verification through an affordable API ($79/month starter tier), we enable smaller companies -- including minority-owned, women-owned, and community-based enterprises -- to compete on equal footing with large national installers. This directly creates economic opportunity in the solar workforce.

In California, the solar industry employs over 75,000 workers. By reducing administrative overhead, SolarOS allows installers to complete more projects per employee, growing revenue without proportionally growing costs -- enabling wage increases and new hires.

**2. Increasing Access to Clean Energy Solutions**

Low-income and disadvantaged communities are disproportionately affected by high soft costs. When permitting adds $1,500-2,000 to a solar installation, marginal projects in underserved areas become economically unviable. SolarOS reduces this barrier, making solar pencil out in communities where it currently does not.

Our database already tracks low-income solar programs across all 50 states, including California-specific programs like DAC-SASH (Disadvantaged Communities - Single-family Affordable Solar Homes), SOMAH (Solar on Multifamily Affordable Housing), and California's community solar programs. By integrating incentive discovery into the permitting workflow, we ensure that eligible households are connected with available programs.

**3. Decreasing Pollution Burden**

California's disadvantaged communities -- as defined by CalEnviroScreen -- bear disproportionate pollution burdens from fossil fuel generation. Every solar installation that SolarOS accelerates displaces fossil generation, and the CO2 impact is greatest in communities adjacent to natural gas peaker plants. Our climate impact modeling shows that at scale (50,000 projects/year), SolarOS accelerates 24,200 metric tons of annual CO2 reduction.

**4. Deployment in Disadvantaged Communities**

SolarOS is designed to be deployed in any California jurisdiction. Our 7 CA jurisdictions include areas with significant disadvantaged community populations (Los Angeles, Fresno, Long Beach). We intend to prioritize expansion into additional CA jurisdictions with high CalEnviroScreen scores, ensuring our permit intelligence covers the areas where solar deployment provides the greatest equity benefit.

**5. Improving Resilience**

California's wildfire and extreme heat events create growing urgency for distributed energy resilience. SolarOS accelerates solar-plus-storage deployment by streamlining the permitting process for combined systems. Our compliance engine already tracks battery storage requirements alongside solar, enabling faster deployment of resilient distributed energy systems in communities vulnerable to grid outages and public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).

---

#### 4B. What are the key risks to your project and how will you mitigate them? (~200 words)

**1. Technology Area Alignment Risk**
CalSEED technology areas change each cohort. SolarOS may not fit the announced categories.
*Mitigation*: Monitor CalSEED announcements closely. SolarOS qualifies under broad categories like "clean energy generation," "distributed energy," or "grid software." If no category fits, we will not apply and will target alternative programs.

**2. Installer Adoption Risk**
Solar installers may resist changing their workflow for a new platform.
*Mitigation*: Design SolarOS to integrate into existing workflows rather than replace them. API-first architecture means installers can use SolarOS through their current tools (Aurora, Enerflo). Pilot program includes hands-on onboarding and white-glove support.

**3. Data Accuracy Risk**
Jurisdictional requirements change frequently, and stale data creates liability.
*Mitigation*: Automated data refresh pipelines from primary sources. Human validation layer for critical jurisdictions. Community feedback mechanism where installers flag outdated information. Confidence scores on all data points.

**4. SolarAPP+ Integration Risk**
SolarAPP+ API access may be restricted or change.
*Mitigation*: SolarOS provides value independent of SolarAPP+ integration. Our permit intelligence database and compliance engine work regardless. SolarAPP+ integration is additive, not dependent.

**5. California Registration**
CalSEED requires California address and good standing.
*Mitigation*: Ensure Agentic Labs LLC is properly registered in California before application window opens. [Justin to confirm current status]

### SECTION 5: TEAM & CAPABILITIES

#### 5A. Describe the team that will execute this project. Include relevant experience and qualifications. (~300 words)

**Justin Griffith -- Founder & CEO**
[Justin to add: 2-3 sentences on relevant background -- solar industry experience, software engineering experience, entrepreneurial history, what drives your mission]

Justin brings [experience to be added] to SolarOS. As the sole founder, he has built the entire platform from concept through working prototype, including the national permit database, compliance engine, API marketplace, and subscription billing system.

**AI-Augmented Development Approach**

SolarOS employs a novel development methodology that is itself a demonstration of the platform's core thesis: AI does the work, humans provide judgment. The platform is built using Claude Code (Anthropic) for code generation and Ava, a custom AI agent system running on dedicated infrastructure, for research, data collection, and task execution.

This approach enables a lean team to operate at the speed and output of a much larger organization. The same AI-human collaboration pattern that built SolarOS is the pattern the product delivers to solar installers: AI handles routine tasks, escalates when uncertain, and learns from human decisions.

**Technical Infrastructure**
- Full-stack development: React frontend, Firebase Cloud Functions backend, Firestore database
- Production deployment on Firebase Hosting with live API endpoints
- Stripe, Mercury, and Twilio integrations operational
- Dedicated Mac Studio server running 24/7 AI agent infrastructure
- 13 MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for automated development workflows

**Advisory Network**
[Justin to add: Any advisors, mentors, industry contacts. CalSEED FAQ notes that letters of support "look good" -- consider obtaining from: solar installers, industry associations like CALSSA, municipal building department contacts, academic partners]

**Planned Hires (with CalSEED funding)**
- Solar industry domain expert (part-time, California market knowledge)
- Installer relations / pilot program coordinator
- Data validation specialist for California jurisdictional expansion

---

### SECTION 6: LETTERS OF SUPPORT (Optional but Recommended)

CalSEED FAQ states letters of support are "not required but look good if you have them."

## EVALUATION CRITERIA STRATEGY

### How to Score High on Each Dimension

#### 1. Innovation (Highest Weight -- Technical Novelty & Quality)

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Self-learning AI task engine is architecturally novel -- not just a static rules engine, but a system that improves with every human interaction
- National-scale permit intelligence database with 106 jurisdictions is unprecedented -- no competitor has this breadth with this depth
- Open API architecture differentiates from closed ecosystems (Aurora/Lyra, proprietary platforms)
- AI compliance engine for domestic content + FEOC + tariff verification is a 2026-specific innovation that no existing platform addresses
- Software innovation directly applicable to California's grid planning and distributed energy deployment

**Weak Points to Address:**
- SolarOS is a software platform, not a physical technology breakthrough. Frame as: "Software is the enabling technology for hardware deployment. Without permitting automation, hardware innovation alone cannot achieve deployment targets."
- Working prototype is more advanced than typical TRL 2-4 applicants. Frame as: "Platform is built; what's needed is California-specific validation and pilot deployment with real installers."

#### 2. Social Impact & Energy Equity

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Reduces cost barrier for low-income solar access (lower soft costs = viable projects in underserved communities)
- Levels playing field for small/minority-owned installers vs. large nationals
- Tracks CA-specific equity programs: DAC-SASH, SOMAH, community solar
- Priority expansion into high CalEnviroScreen jurisdictions
- Directly supports AB 2188 and SB 379 compliance, which are equity-focused mandates
- Quantifiable: every permit accelerated in a disadvantaged community = faster pollution reduction in that community

**Weak Points to Address:**
- No direct community engagement yet. Mitigate by: committing to pilot with at least one installer serving disadvantaged communities, partnering with community solar organization.

#### 3. Team & Approach

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- Working product demonstrates execution capability (built entire platform bootstrapped)
- AI-augmented development approach is itself evidence of the product thesis
- Clear, phased scope of work with measurable milestones
- Risk identification shows awareness of real challenges
- Lean team + AI tools = capital-efficient execution

**Weak Points to Address:**
- Solo founder risk. Mitigate by: emphasizing advisory network, planned hires with CalSEED funding, AI augmentation enabling solo execution at scale.
- No solar industry track record (if applicable). Mitigate by: emphasizing deep technical research, data-driven approach, platform already contains more jurisdictional data than most industry veterans have memorized.

## ALTERNATIVE TIMING: PROTOTYPE AWARD ($500,000)

If SolarOS wins a Concept Award, the Prototype Award is the next step. This is a competitive Business Plan Competition among Concept Award winners. The Prototype Award provides $500,000 for advancing from concept to prototype demonstration.

**Total potential CalSEED funding: $700,000 ($200K Concept + $500K Prototype)**

This is significant non-dilutive capital for a pre-seed company. Combined with Venture For ClimateTech (if accepted) and other grant programs, SolarOS could fund its first 18-24 months entirely through non-dilutive grants.
