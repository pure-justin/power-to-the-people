## 1. Wikipedia Article Creation

Wikipedia is the most powerful credibility signal for founders and companies. Investors, journalists, and partners check it reflexively. However, Wikipedia has strict notability requirements and conflict-of-interest policies. This must be handled carefully.

### Notability Criteria (What Wikipedia Requires)

For a **company** article, Wikipedia requires "significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources." This means:

- **Multiple** published articles about the company (not by the company)
- In **independent** publications (not press releases, not company blog)
- With **significant** coverage (not just a mention in a list)
- From **reliable** sources (established newspapers, trade publications, not blogs)

For a **person** article, similar criteria apply, plus the person must be notable for reasons beyond running a single company.

### Current Notability Gap and How to Close It

**Justin Griffith currently does NOT meet Wikipedia notability standards.** This is not a criticism -- most startup founders do not until they have significant press coverage. Here is how to build toward it:

**Phase 1: Establish Independent Coverage (Months 1-3)**
- Get quoted as an industry expert in 3-5 trade publications (Solar Power World, PV Magazine, etc.)
- Secure 2-3 feature articles about SolarOS in independent outlets
- Speak at 1-2 industry conferences (creates citable coverage)
- Get listed in industry reports or analyst coverage

**Phase 2: Build the Source Base (Months 3-6)**
- Secure coverage in mainstream business press (San Antonio Business Journal, Austin Business Journal)
- Get quoted in national outlets on solar policy topics (Bloomberg, Reuters, AP)
- Publish op-eds in industry publications (creates additional citable sources)
- Win at least one industry award (creates independent third-party validation)

**Phase 3: Create the Article (Month 6+)**
- **Do NOT create the article yourself.** Wikipedia has strict conflict-of-interest (COI) policies. Self-created articles are frequently deleted.
- **Option A:** Hire a Wikipedia-compliant editor through a service like WhiteHatWiki or WikiExperts. Cost: $2,000-$5,000. They will assess notability and either create the article or tell you what additional coverage you need.
- **Option B:** Request creation through Wikipedia's "Articles for Creation" (AfC) process. Submit a draft with all sources. Volunteer editors review and either accept or decline with feedback.
- **Option C:** Once you have 5+ independent sources, a Wikipedia editor may create the article organically (this is the gold standard).

### Key Rules
- Never edit your own Wikipedia article
- Never pay someone to edit without full disclosure on Wikipedia
- Focus on building real coverage first -- the article follows naturally
- Pure Energy at $100M revenue may independently meet notability for a company article -- research whether coverage of Pure Energy exists in independent Texas business press

   - Rolling close capability

---

## 4. Product Hunt Launch

Product Hunt is the premier platform for new product launches and drives significant early-stage credibility, press coverage, and user acquisition.

### Pre-Launch Preparation (2-4 Weeks Before)

**Build a Hunter Network:**
- Identify a well-known Product Hunt hunter to submit your product (top hunters include Chris Messina, Kevin William David, Ben Tossell)
- Reach out 2-3 weeks before target launch
- Alternatively, submit yourself (founder submissions perform well in climate tech)

**Prepare Assets:**
- Product logo (240x240, PNG, no rounded corners)
- Gallery images (5-8 screenshots showing key features)
- Product tagline (60 characters max): "AI-powered solar permitting and compliance for all 50 states"
- Description (260 characters max): "SolarOS automates solar deployment -- national permit database (106 jurisdictions), AI compliance engine, 190+ incentives, 485+ utility rates. Built by a $100M solar CEO who lived the problem."
- First comment (prepared by founder -- tell the story)
- Maker video (optional, 2-3 minutes, screen recording with voiceover)

**First Comment Draft:**
> Hi Product Hunt -- I'm Justin, CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies ($100M peak revenue, thousands of installations). I built SolarOS because I got tired of the operational chaos killing our industry.
>
> Solar hardware costs have dropped 90%. But soft costs -- permitting, compliance, interconnection -- now exceed the hardware itself. Every city has different rules. Every utility has different rates. And federal compliance changes constantly.
>
> SolarOS is the operational intelligence layer I wish existed when I was scaling Pure Energy. National permit database. AI compliance engine. Incentive tracking. Equipment scoring. All accessible via API.
>
> The 2026 market reset (ITC expiration, tariff chaos, net billing transition) makes this more urgent than ever. Happy to answer any questions about solar, permitting, or building software as a non-traditional founder.

**Build Upvote Momentum:**
- Email your network the morning of launch (6:00 AM PT)
- Post on LinkedIn, Twitter/X
- Notify any beta users or early customers
- Do NOT ask for upvotes explicitly (against PH guidelines) -- share the link and let people decide

### Launch Day Strategy

- **Best day:** Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
- **Target:** Top 5 of the day (unlocks "Product of the Day" badge)
- **Engage actively:** Respond to every comment within 30 minutes
- **Share updates:** Post progress throughout the day

### Post-Launch
- Add "Featured on Product Hunt" badge to website
- Share results on LinkedIn
- Follow up with commenters who expressed interest
- Write a launch retrospective post

---

## 5. LinkedIn Thought Leadership

LinkedIn is the highest-leverage platform for B2B credibility in solar and climate tech. Justin's unique positioning (operator-turned-founder with $100M company) is a powerful differentiator.

### Profile Optimization

1. **Headline:** "CEO, Pure Energy ($100M solar) | Founder, SolarOS | Building the operational intelligence layer for solar deployment"
2. **About section:** Use the medium bio from founder-profile.md
3. **Featured section:** Pin the press release, Product Hunt launch, and one strong data post
4. **Experience:** List both Pure Energy (CEO, with revenue milestone) and Agentic Labs (Founder)
5. **Skills:** Solar Energy, SaaS, Artificial Intelligence, Operations Management, Regulatory Compliance, Climate Tech

### Content Strategy (3 Posts Per Week)

**Content Pillars:**

| Pillar | Frequency | Examples |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Industry Intelligence** | 1x/week | "Here's what the 2026 ITC expiration actually means for installers" |
| **Operator Insights** | 1x/week | "After 1,000+ installations, here's what I know about permitting" |
| **Builder's Journey** | 1x/week | "I'm a solar CEO building software. Here's what I've learned" |

**Post Formats That Perform:**
- Data-driven insights (charts, statistics, counter-intuitive findings)
- "Lessons from" posts (lessons from scaling to $100M, from managing 50 permitting jurisdictions)
- Contrarian takes (why the solar industry's real problem isn't hardware costs)
- Behind-the-scenes building (product screenshots, development updates, customer feedback)

**Sample Post Calendar (First Month):**

| Week | Post 1 (Mon) | Post 2 (Wed) | Post 3 (Fri) |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | "The 2026 solar reset: what every installer needs to know" | "Why I built SolarOS after managing $100M in solar installs" | Data: permitting timelines across 10 Texas cities |
| 2 | "Domestic content compliance: the rules nobody understands" | "What happens when a solar CEO learns to code" | Data: ITC vs. TPO economics comparison |
| 3 | "The real cost of solar permitting (it's not what you think)" | Product update: new jurisdictions added | "5 things I'd tell my day-1 self about scaling a solar company" |
| 4 | "FEOC compliance is about to matter more than panel efficiency" | Customer story or use case | "Why I'm bullish on solar despite the 2026 headwinds" |

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Comment on posts by solar industry leaders, VCs, and policy analysts
- Join and contribute to LinkedIn groups: Solar Energy Industries Association, CleanTech, Energy Transition
- Tag relevant people when sharing industry data (analysts, journalists, other founders)
- Respond to every comment on your posts within 4 hours

**For tech press:** Lead with the AI/technical angle and the non-traditional founder story. A solar CEO teaching himself to code using AI tools is a genuinely interesting story.

**Pitch Template:**
> Subject: $100M Solar CEO Builds AI Platform to Fix Permitting Crisis [Exclusive Data]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm Justin Griffith, CEO of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar companies. After managing thousands of installations and hitting $100M in revenue, I built SolarOS -- an AI platform that automates the permitting and compliance nightmare that's driving up solar costs nationwide.
>
> I have data that might interest your readers: [specific data point relevant to their coverage].
>
> Happy to share exclusively, or just be a source on solar operations and the 2026 market reset. I'm an operator, not a PR person -- I'll give you the real story.
>

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with operator credibility, not product features.** Justin's $100M company and thousands of installations are the differentiator. Every pitch should start there.

2. **Data is the hook.** The permit database (106 jurisdictions), the incentive count (190+), the utility rates (485+) -- these are concrete, specific, and attention-grabbing. Use them.

3. **The 2026 reset is timely.** The ITC expiration, tariff chaos, and net billing transition make every story urgent. This is a narrow window where the press is hungry for expert voices.

4. **Be a source, not a salesman.** Offer expertise and data to journalists. The product sells itself when you're the go-to expert on solar operations.

5. **Consistency beats virality.** Three LinkedIn posts a week, every week, for six months will build more credibility than one viral moment. Show up reliably.

6. **Stack credentials.** Each piece of credibility makes the next easier to get. Crunchbase profile leads to press coverage leads to speaking invitations leads to awards leads to Wikipedia notability. It compounds.
