## RESEARCH SUMMARY

### About Elemental Impact

Elemental Impact is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit investor focused on scaling innovative climate technologies with deep environmental and local impact. Founded in 2009 in Honolulu, Hawaii (originally as Energy Excelerator, then Elemental Excelerator), the organization has invested in 160+ portfolio companies, catalyzed $11.5B in follow-on funding, deployed 150+ projects, and created 17,000+ jobs. Offices in Honolulu, San Francisco, New York City, and Washington DC.

### Investment Thesis

Elemental backs "bold entrepreneurs with technologies that solve a problem, have proven demand, and are ready to scale." They target the "$150B Scale Gap" — the funding and expertise shortfall between early traction and commercial viability. Their model combines catalytic capital, expert coaching (2,000+ hours/year), local partnerships (2,500+ partners), and investor mobilization ($1.4B in co-investment).

### Why SolarOS Is a Strong Fit

1. **Direct successor to Sighten's thesis**: Sighten (funded by Elemental) automated the solar workflow from lead to financing. SolarOS extends that thesis to the compliance and permitting layer — the piece Sighten never fully solved
2. **Complements Symbium**: Symbium focuses on government-side instant permitting. SolarOS focuses on installer-side automation — these are complementary, not competitive
3. **2026 timing**: The residential ITC expiration and tariff complexity created an urgent need for compliance automation that didn't exist when Sighten was funded
4. **Equity alignment**: SolarOS's core thesis is that reducing soft costs disproportionately benefits low-income communities, community solar programs, and small installers
5. **Deep local impact potential**: Platform enables deployment of solar in underserved communities by removing the expertise barrier and automating compliance with LMI programs

### 2. Company Description (~200 words)

SolarOS is an AI-powered solar deployment platform that automates the permit-to-install pipeline for residential and commercial solar. While solar panel costs have dropped 90%, soft costs — permitting, compliance verification, and interconnection paperwork — now represent over 50% of total residential solar costs. With 30,000+ permitting jurisdictions in the US, each with different rules, forms, fees, and timelines, installers waste 20+ hours per project on paperwork instead of putting panels on roofs.

SolarOS solves this with a national permit intelligence database (106 city jurisdictions across all 50 states), an AI compliance engine that verifies domestic content, FEOC, and tariff requirements in real time, and a self-learning task engine where AI attempts every task first, escalates to humans when it fails, then learns from the human's actions. The platform tracks 190+ incentive programs, 485+ utility rate profiles, and 72+ equipment products.

The 2026 industry reset — ITC expiration, tariffs up to 3,400% on SE Asian panels, new domestic content mandates — created compliance complexity that manual processes simply cannot handle. SolarOS turns this complexity into a competitive advantage for installers, while ensuring every home reaches clean energy faster.

---

### 3. Problem Statement

**The solar industry has a deployment speed crisis, and it's not about the panels.**

Solar hardware costs have plummeted 90% in a decade, but the US is still deploying solar far too slowly to meet climate goals. The bottleneck is soft costs:

- **Permitting costs $0.24/watt** (NREL), adding $1,920 to a typical 8 kW residential system
- **30,000+ jurisdictions** each have different requirements, fees, forms, portals, and review timelines
- **Average permitting timeline: 2-8 weeks** depending on jurisdiction, with some taking months
- **Installers spend 20+ hours per project** on paperwork, compliance checks, and permit submissions
- **64% of solar soft costs** are attributable to permitting, inspection, and interconnection (DOE SunShot)

The 2026 industry reset made this dramatically worse:

1. **Residential ITC expired January 1, 2026** — margins are squeezed, so every dollar of soft cost matters more than ever
2. **Tariffs up to 3,400%** on Southeast Asian panels created complex compliance requirements for domestic content and country-of-origin verification
3. **FEOC regulations** (Foreign Entity of Concern) added new verification burdens for battery and inverter components
4. **TPO shift**: With the residential ITC gone, third-party ownership (lease/PPA) now dominates — each deal involves commercial tax credit compliance, adding complexity that didn't exist before

**Every day of permitting delay is a day a home isn't generating clean energy.** At 338 kg CO2 per month per project, permitting delays are a direct climate cost that compounds across millions of installations.

**The communities that suffer most are the ones that can least afford it.** Low-income neighborhoods, rural communities, and communities of color face the steepest barriers because smaller community-based installers serving these areas cannot afford dedicated compliance staff, and the complexity of LMI incentive programs (DAC-SASH, LIHEAP-solar, Solar for All) adds even more paperwork to every project.

### 5. Climate / Environmental Impact

**Direct Impact: Accelerating Solar Deployment**

Every month of permitting delay per project = 338 kg of CO2 that could have been offset.

*Calculation:*
- Average US residential solar system: 8 kW
- Average annual production: 10,500 kWh
- US grid emission factor: 0.386 kg CO2/kWh (EPA eGRID 2024)
- Annual CO2 offset per system: 4,053 kg (4.05 metric tons)
- Per month: 338 kg CO2

**At scale (conservative projections):**

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Projects accelerated | 1,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 |
| Avg. time saved per project | 3 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |
| CO2 acceleration impact | 242 MT | 3,227 MT | 24,200 MT |
| Lifetime CO2 impact (25 yr) | 101,325 MT | 1,013,250 MT | 5,066,250 MT |

**Indirect Impact: Enabling Market Expansion**

By reducing soft costs by $0.10-0.15/watt, SolarOS makes solar economically viable for an additional ~2 million US households currently on the margin of economic viability. Each home that crosses the threshold represents ~100 metric tons of lifetime CO2 reduction.

**Systemic Impact: Breaking the Expertise Barrier**

Today, only large installers (Sunrun, Tesla, Sunnova) can afford dedicated compliance and permitting staff. This creates market concentration that limits deployment in underserved communities. SolarOS democratizes this capability, enabling hundreds of smaller regional and community-based installers to operate at the compliance sophistication of the major players — reaching communities that large national installers systematically underserve.

### 6. Social Impact / Equity & Access

*This section is structured around Elemental's "Equity In" and "Equity Out" framework.*

#### Equity Out: Community Benefit

**1. Reducing Soft Costs in Low-Income Communities**
Permitting and compliance costs are regressive — they represent a fixed cost per project regardless of system size or homeowner income. A $1,920 permitting cost burden on a $20,000 system is nearly 10% of the project cost. SolarOS's automation eliminates a significant portion of this cost, making solar viable in communities where every dollar matters.

**2. Enabling Community Solar Programs (24+ states)**
Community solar allows renters, apartment dwellers, and homeowners with shaded roofs to access solar benefits. But community solar projects face even more complex permitting because they involve commercial installations, interconnection agreements, and subscriber management. SolarOS tracks community solar program requirements in 24+ states, reducing a major barrier to deployment.

**3. Energy Community Bonus Credits (147+ counties)**
The IRS energy community bonus credit provides a 10% adder for projects in qualifying areas — many of which are disadvantaged communities affected by fossil fuel industry decline. SolarOS tracks 147+ qualifying counties and automatically flags eligible projects, ensuring these communities capture the maximum available incentives.

**4. Low-Income Program Integration**
SolarOS's incentive database includes:
- **LIHEAP-solar pathways**: Connecting low-income energy assistance recipients to solar programs
- **DAC-SASH** (Disadvantaged Communities — Single-family Affordable Solar Homes): California's program for homeowners in census tracts scoring in the top 25% on CalEnviroScreen
- **Solar for All alternatives**: State-level successors to the federal Solar for All program
- **State-specific LMI programs**: Income-qualified rebates, grants, and financing in 30+ states

**5. Empowering Community-Based Installers**
Small, community-rooted solar installers serve neighborhoods that national companies ignore. But these installers lack the compliance infrastructure to navigate complex permitting across jurisdictions, verify domestic content requirements, or qualify projects for bonus credits. SolarOS provides enterprise-grade compliance tools at a price point ($79/month) that a two-person installation company can afford.

#### Equity In: Internal Company Practices

**1. AI-Augmented Development Model**
SolarOS is built with an AI-augmented approach (Claude Code + custom AI agent Ava), demonstrating that a small, diverse team can build at the scale of much larger companies. This model inherently levels the playing field — the barrier to building sophisticated climate software is no longer headcount or capital, but vision and capability.

**2. Hiring Intentions**
As CEO of Pure Energy, Justin built and managed a workforce of installers, project managers, and permitting specialists drawn predominantly from the San Antonio and broader Texas community. SolarOS will continue this community-rooted hiring approach: prioritizing candidates from the Texas solar installation workforce, partnering with San Antonio-area community colleges and workforce development programs, and creating internship pathways for underrepresented groups entering the clean energy sector. All employees and contractors will be paid at least 150% of the local living wage from day one.

**3. Open Data Philosophy**
SolarOS's permit intelligence database is designed to eventually be available as open data — enabling researchers, policymakers, and community organizations to study permitting barriers and advocate for reform. When one jurisdiction streamlines its process, every community served by SolarOS benefits.

### 7. Market Opportunity

**TAM**: $4.2B — Total US solar soft costs (permitting, customer acquisition, installation labor management)

**SAM**: $1.2B — Permitting and compliance software/services for US residential and commercial solar

**SOM**: $12M — 1% of residential solar permits processed through SolarOS in Year 3

**Why now — the 2026 inflection point:**

1. **Industry reset**: The residential ITC expiration (January 1, 2026) squeezed installer margins, making soft cost reduction existential, not optional
2. **Compliance explosion**: Tariffs up to 3,400% and FEOC regulations created verification complexity that manual processes physically cannot handle at scale
3. **TPO shift**: Every residential deal now involves commercial tax credit compliance (TPO/lease/PPA structure), multiplying the paperwork per project
4. **SolarAPP+ momentum**: DOE-backed automated permitting (500+ jurisdictions) proves the market wants and accepts automation — but SolarAPP+ only covers standard residential, leaving a massive gap
5. **AI maturity**: Large language models and AI agents have reached the capability threshold needed to automate document interpretation, compliance verification, and permit workflow management

**Competitive Landscape:**

| Competitor | Approach | Limitation |
|------------|----------|------------|
| SolarAPP+ (NREL/DOE) | Standardized automated permitting | Requires jurisdiction adoption; standard residential only |
| Symbium | Government-side instant permitting | Government-facing; 39 jurisdictions; no compliance engine |
| Aurora Solar (Lyra) | Acquired Lyra's permitting tech | Closed ecosystem; tied to Aurora platform |
| GreenLancer | Human-powered permit engineering | $300-500/permit; doesn't scale; no AI learning |
| OpenSolar / Enerflo | Solar design + sales platforms | Limited permitting features; no compliance checking |

**SolarOS Differentiation:**
SolarOS is the only platform that combines a national permit intelligence database, real-time compliance engine (domestic content, FEOC, tariffs), and self-improving AI task routing in a single open API. We don't just tell installers what the requirements are — we help them meet them automatically, and we get smarter with every project across every jurisdiction.

### 10. Team

**Justin Griffith — Founder & CEO**
Justin is the CEO and Owner of Pure Energy, one of Texas's largest residential solar installation companies, with peak annual revenue of $100M. Over years of high-volume operations, he managed thousands of solar installations across dozens of Texas jurisdictions, building deep relationships with permitting offices, utility interconnection teams, and inspectors statewide. It was this firsthand experience — watching his teams spend more time on paperwork than on rooftops — that drove him to build SolarOS. He founded Agentic Labs LLC to productize the compliance and permitting automation that Pure Energy needed but no software on the market provided, making Pure Energy the built-in first customer and proving ground for SolarOS.

**Email**: justin@agntc.tech
**LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-griffith-86030013b/

**AI-Augmented Development Approach:**
SolarOS is built with an AI co-development model using Claude Code (Anthropic) and a custom AI agent system (Ava) running on dedicated infrastructure. This enables a small team to operate at the velocity of a 10-15 person engineering team. This isn't just a development methodology — it's the core product philosophy: AI does the work, humans provide judgment.

**Key Hires Planned:**
With Elemental funding, the first two hires will bring the team to 3 FTEs to meet Strategy Track eligibility:
- **Head of Community Partnerships** (Hire #1) — community engagement, installer relationships, and pilot program management. Ideally sourced from the Texas solar workforce or community solar ecosystem. This role will lead Elemental Square Partnership engagements.
- **Head of Data Operations** (Hire #2) — expanding jurisdiction coverage from 106 to 500+ cities, ensuring data quality, and managing SolarAPP+ integration. Justin's established connections with permitting offices across Texas provide a warm-start network for this role.
- **Full-Stack Engineer** (Hire #3) — additional development capacity for API marketplace, mobile field app, and platform integrations with Aurora/Enerflo/OpenSolar.

**Advisors:**
Justin's years leading Pure Energy through the Texas solar market have built a network of industry contacts across installation, financing, and permitting. Formal advisory board to be assembled with Elemental's coaching support — targeting advisors with expertise in solar policy, community solar program design, and climate tech go-to-market.

---

### 12. What Do You Hope to Get from Elemental? (~200 words)

**Three things would be transformative for SolarOS:**

**1. Community partnerships and local deployment expertise.** SolarOS's thesis is that permitting automation benefits underserved communities most — but we need Elemental's network to prove it. Introductions to community solar organizations, GRID Alternatives chapters, affordable housing developers, and community-based installers in target markets would let us pilot the equity impact thesis with real communities. Elemental's Square Partnerships model is exactly the framework we need to structure these engagements authentically.

**2. Go-to-market coaching for a regulated, multi-stakeholder industry.** Solar permitting sits at the intersection of government building departments, utility interconnection teams, state energy offices, and private installers. We need Elemental's 15 years of experience deploying climate technology in communities to help us navigate the decision of whether to sell directly to installers, through existing platforms, to municipalities, or all three simultaneously. Elemental has done this with Sighten, Symbium, Solstice, and others — that pattern-matching is invaluable.

**3. Investor mobilization for our seed round.** Elemental has catalyzed $11.5B in follow-on funding. A stamp of approval from Elemental would signal to climate tech VCs (Earthshot Ventures, Energize Capital, Congruent Ventures) that SolarOS is investment-ready. We need coaching on translating the 2026 industry reset into a fundable narrative.

---

### 13. Deployment / Pilot Plan

**Phase 1: Community Solar Pilot (Months 1-3)**
- Partner with 2-3 community solar organizations in states with strong programs (NY, MA, CA, IL, MN)
- Deploy SolarOS for their permitting and compliance workflows
- Measure: time saved per project, cost reduction, error rate reduction
- Community partner: GRID Alternatives or local community solar provider

**Phase 2: Small Installer Cohort (Months 3-6)**
- Onboard 10 community-based installers (2-10 person companies)
- Target markets: underserved urban and rural communities
- Provide free Professional tier ($149/mo value) during pilot
- Measure: deployment acceleration, customer satisfaction, soft cost reduction

**Phase 3: Platform Integration (Months 6-9)**
- Develop API integration with 1-2 major platforms (Aurora, Enerflo, or OpenSolar)
- White-label permit intelligence for existing installer workflows
- Measure: API adoption, platform partner satisfaction, revenue from API calls

**Community Partnership Framework (aligned with Square Partnerships):**
- Identify community partners before deployment
- Develop commitment letters with mutual expectations
- Compensate community partners for their expertise and access
- Include community feedback loops in product development
- Report impact metrics to community stakeholders quarterly

---

### 14. Hawaii Connection (Elemental's home base)

Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the US ($0.35-0.45/kWh) and the highest residential solar adoption rate (~37% of homes). Permitting in Hawaii is complex due to county-level jurisdiction, historic district restrictions, hurricane-rated structural requirements, and interconnection limits from HECO/MECO/HELCO.

**SolarOS Hawaii opportunity:**
- Add all 4 Hawaii county jurisdictions to the permit database
- Partner with local installers serving Native Hawaiian and low-income communities
- Connect with Hawaii Energy (ratepayer-funded efficiency program) for outreach
- Align with Hawaii's 100% renewable energy by 2045 mandate

SolarOS is fully willing to engage the Hawaii market as part of the Elemental pilot. Hawaii's extreme electricity costs and high solar adoption make it an ideal proof point for permitting automation, and Elemental's Honolulu roots provide natural community partnership opportunities. Adding all 4 Hawaii county jurisdictions to the permit database is a straightforward data expansion that aligns with SolarOS's national coverage mission.

## STRATEGIC PRECEDENT: SIGHTEN & SYMBIUM

### Sighten (Elemental Portfolio → Acquired by SunPower)

**What Sighten did**: Software platform spanning the entire solar asset lifecycle — from lead origination, system design, and sales/operations to automated reporting and analytics. Reduced proposals from a few per day to 100+ per day.

**Elemental investment thesis**: Solar software that accelerates deployment by removing friction from the sales and financing workflow.

**What happened**: Sighten was acquired by SunPower, validating the thesis that solar software platforms create enormous value by reducing soft costs.

**Community impact**: In partnership with GRID Alternatives, Sighten designed and installed solar at no cost for 10 households in East Palo Alto and California's Bay Area.

**SolarOS parallel**: SolarOS extends Sighten's thesis downstream — from the sales/financing workflow to the permitting/compliance/installation workflow. Where Sighten asked "how do we make solar easier to sell?", SolarOS asks "how do we make solar easier to deploy?"

### Symbium (Current Elemental Portfolio)

**What Symbium does**: Instant permitting for residential solar, ESS, and electrification projects. Government-facing platform that enables municipalities to offer instant permit approval. Active in 39+ jurisdictions including Burlingame, Irvine, and Burbank, CA.

**Elemental investment thesis**: Permitting automation is a critical bottleneck for clean energy deployment.

**SolarOS complement**: Symbium works on the government side (helping municipalities process permits faster). SolarOS works on the installer side (helping installers prepare, submit, and track permits across any jurisdiction). These are complementary platforms:

| Dimension | Symbium | SolarOS |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Customer | Municipalities | Installers |
| Approach | Government portal integration | Installer workflow automation |
| Coverage | 39 jurisdictions (deep) | 106 jurisdictions (broad) |
| Value prop | Instant permit issuance | Instant permit preparation + compliance |
| Expansion | Jurisdiction by jurisdiction | National from day 1 |

**Partnership opportunity**: SolarOS could integrate with Symbium-enabled jurisdictions for end-to-end automated permitting — instant preparation on the installer side, instant approval on the government side.

## STRATEGIC NOTES FOR JUSTIN

### Why Elemental Is a Top-Tier Opportunity

1. **Non-dilutive or founder-friendly capital**: The D-SAFE lets you repay instead of converting to equity. Even a standard SAFE is better than VC equity at pre-seed.
2. **$11.5B follow-on catalysis**: Elemental's stamp of approval is a signal to every climate tech VC in the market.
3. **Nonprofit investor**: Their incentives are impact, not returns. They will support your equity thesis rather than pressuring you to maximize revenue at the expense of community impact.
4. **160+ portfolio network**: Immediate peer group of climate tech founders who've navigated similar challenges.
5. **9 months of coaching**: 2-4 hours/week of expert guidance on go-to-market, fundraising, community engagement, and policy.
6. **Rolling applications**: No deadline pressure — submit when the application is strong, not when a deadline forces you.

### Key Risks to Address

1. **3-FTE minimum**: Currently 1 FTE (founder). Application includes concrete hiring plan for 2 additional FTEs with Elemental funding. Justin's Pure Energy network provides immediate access to experienced solar industry talent in Texas.
2. **Revenue**: Pre-revenue, but Pure Energy ($100M peak revenue, thousands of installations) is the built-in first customer. This is not a cold start — SolarOS is being built by someone who ran one of the operations it serves. Frame Pure Energy as a committed pilot partner with real transaction volume.
3. **Symbium overlap**: Address this head-on. SolarOS is complementary, not competitive. Symbium works on the government side; SolarOS works on the installer side.
4. **Solo founder**: Justin is not a first-time entrepreneur — he built and ran Pure Energy to $100M in revenue managing thousands of installations. The AI-augmented development model plus deep industry experience is a credible substitute for a large founding team. Hiring plan shows path to 3+ FTEs within months of funding.

### Framing for Elemental (vs. Other Applications)

| Emphasis | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Equity and community impact | Elemental's core differentiator as a nonprofit investor |
| Community partnerships | Square Partnerships model alignment |
| Sighten/Symbium precedent | Shows Elemental already believes in this thesis |
| Local deployment | Elemental values projects with local, tangible impact |
| Coaching need | Elemental wants companies that will engage with their support model |
| Scale gap | Frame SolarOS as a "FOAK" — first automated compliance platform for solar |
