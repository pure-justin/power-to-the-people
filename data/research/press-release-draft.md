## $100M Solar CEO Launches AI Platform to Fix the Industry's Biggest Operational Crisis

**SolarOS automates permitting, compliance, and installation management across all 50 states as the 2026 market reset reshapes residential solar**

**SAN ANTONIO, TX -- February 2026** -- Justin Griffith, CEO of Pure Energy -- one of Texas's largest residential solar installation companies with peak annual revenue of $100 million -- today announced the launch of SolarOS, an AI-powered solar deployment platform built to eliminate the soft cost crisis crippling the U.S. solar industry.

SolarOS, developed by Griffith's company Agentic Labs LLC, provides a national permit database covering 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states, an AI compliance engine for domestic content, FEOC, and tariff verification, and comprehensive intelligence on 190+ incentive programs, 485+ utility rates, and 72+ equipment products. The platform is available immediately at https://power-to-the-people-vpp.web.app.

### The Problem: Soft Costs Are Eating the Solar Industry

While hardware costs for solar panels have dropped more than 90% over the past decade, soft costs -- permitting, compliance verification, utility interconnection, and project management -- now account for over 60% of total residential solar installation costs. Every municipality has different permitting requirements. Every utility has different interconnection rules. And federal compliance requirements around domestic content, foreign entities of concern, and trade tariffs change constantly.

"I've managed thousands of solar installations across dozens of Texas jurisdictions," said Griffith. "I've seen firsthand how a project that takes two days to install can take two months to permit. I've watched small installers go under because they couldn't keep up with the compliance paperwork. The operational side of solar is broken, and it's the single biggest barrier to adoption that nobody in Silicon Valley is talking about."

### The 2026 Inflection Point

The launch comes at a critical moment for the solar industry. As of January 1, 2026, the residential Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has expired for homeowner-owned systems, forcing a rapid shift to third-party ownership models (leases and PPAs) where commercial-grade compliance verification is mandatory. Simultaneously, tariffs of up to 3,400% on Southeast Asian solar panels have thrown the equipment supply chain into chaos, and the nationwide transition from net metering to net billing is rewriting the economics of every solar project.

"The 2026 reset is the most disruptive event in residential solar since the ITC was created," said Griffith. "Every installer in America needs to verify domestic content compliance, check FEOC status, navigate tariff exposure, and recalculate project economics under net billing -- for every single project. You can't do that with spreadsheets and phone calls anymore."

### An Operator's Platform, Not a Tech Demo

Unlike solar software built by technologists who study the industry from the outside, SolarOS was built by an operator who lived it. Griffith scaled Pure Energy into a statewide operation covering most of Texas, building relationships with installers and municipal permitting offices along the way. That domain expertise is embedded in every feature of the platform.

SolarOS capabilities include:

- **National Permit Database:** Requirements, fees, timelines, and contacts for 106 jurisdictions across all 50 states
- **AI Compliance Engine:** Real-time verification of domestic content (50% U.S. threshold), FEOC (no China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran), and tariff exposure
- **Incentive Intelligence:** 190+ federal, state, and local incentive programs matched to specific projects
- **Utility Rate Library:** 485+ utility rate structures for accurate savings projections
- **Equipment Database:** 72+ panels, inverters, and batteries with compliance scoring
- **API Marketplace:** Six RESTful endpoints with Stripe subscription billing, enabling any software platform to embed SolarOS data
- **Self-Learning AI Engine:** The system attempts tasks autonomously, falls back to human expertise when needed, and learns from every interaction

"I built SolarOS because I needed it," said Griffith. "Pure Energy needed a way to manage compliance and permitting at scale, and nothing on the market could do it. So I built the tool myself, and now I'm making it available to every installer, EPC, and developer in the country."

### Subscription Model

SolarOS is available in three subscription tiers: Starter ($79/month) for small installers, Professional ($149/month) for mid-size companies, and Enterprise ($299/month) for national operations. An API marketplace with usage-based pricing allows software platforms to integrate SolarOS data directly into their own products.
