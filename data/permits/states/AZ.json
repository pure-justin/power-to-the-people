The state pioneered distributed solar but has seen controversy over rate changes reducing export compensation. SRP's demand-based rates have been particularly contentious. Many jurisdictions participate in SolSmart or SolarAPP+ for expedited permitting. Strong solar resource makes Arizona one of the best states for solar generation despite policy headwinds.",
