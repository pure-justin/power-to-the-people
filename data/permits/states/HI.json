The state has the highest per-capita solar adoption rate. Grid saturation on some islands has caused interconnection delays and curtailment. Battery storage is increasingly required for new installations to manage grid impacts. 100% renewable energy mandate by 2045. Unique island grid challenges not found in mainland states.",
