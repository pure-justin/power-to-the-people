    "net_metering_details": "Indiana ended traditional net metering in 2022 for new customers. Replaced with excess distributed generation (EDG) rate that is less than retail. Existing net metering customers grandfathered until 2032. Indiana Michigan Power, Duke Energy Indiana, and Indianapolis Power & Light are major utilities.

  "notes": "Indiana's solar market was negatively impacted by the end of net metering in 2022. The EDG rate replacement provides less compensation than retail net metering. No state solar tax credit. Property tax exemption available for solar equipment for residential systems. The state's relatively low electricity rates reduce the payback period advantage. Rural electric cooperatives may have different interconnection rules than IOUs."
